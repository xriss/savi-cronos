  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Close to nine years into the crisis, the scale, severity, and complexity of needs across Syria remain staggering. In addition, COVID-19 is exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation. At least 5 million people are in critical need of improved water quality and quantity and 4.7 million people face sanitation related issues.  
Protracted and new displacements and people returning to their place of origin put further pressure on the overburdened education system. As a result, one in three schools are partially damaged or destroyed. This has led to a reduction in access to education facilities and overcrowded classrooms. 


AAH has been assessing villages in Aleppo and Idleb governorates showing how the water and sanitation systems have been affected, including WASH facilities in schools, as a consequence of the destruction, whereas the dependency on water trucking and the use of contaminated shallow water has increased. Urgent needs have been identified and significant gaps exist due to lack of repairs and/or minimal and poor maintenance of water and sanitation systems. 


Taking into consideration the 2020 1st Standard Allocation strategy, the 2020 HRP WASH objectives and the needs identified in the field, AAH will focus on the repair and rehabilitation of public water and sewerage systems for water supply and proper sanitation, as well as undertake light rehabilitation of WASH facilities in primary and secondary schools. 

The proposed intervention targets a total of 26,818 individuals (49% females 70% children) in the following locations: 
(1) Aleppo governorate, Menbij district, Maskana sub-district: 12,200 individuals (returnees) will receive Community WASH component and 9,060 individuals (returnees, IDPs) WASH in School activities. AAH will rehabilitate 56 primary and/or secondary schools benefitting 8,676 children and 384 teachers. 
(2) Aleppo governorate, Menbij district, Al-Khafsa sub-district: 4,823 individuals (returnees and IDPs) will benefit from WASH in School activities. AAH will rehabilitate 23 primary and/or secondary schools benefitting 4,650 children and 173 teachers.
(3) Idleb governorate, Abul Thohur: 735 individuals (returnees and IDPs) will benefit from WASH in School activities. AAH will rehabilitate 7 primary and/or secondary schools benefitting 693 children and 42 teachers.

These interventions will contribute to WASH cluster strategic objectives (1) Support to water, sanitation/sewage and solid waste management systems to ensure regular services for affected people in Syria and (3) Improve WASH facilities and services in institutions to minimize substandard WASH conditions of the most vulnerable people in Syria. 

The WASH in schools component comprising of following activities, repair and rehabilitation of WASH facilities in 86 schools, is estimated to cost USD 400,000 and covered by SHF, whereas the community WASH component, comprising of the following activities, repair and rehabilitation of water and sewage systems, and covered by SHF, is estimated to cost USD 630,000. The project will reach 26,818 beneficiaries (14,618 in Schools, 12,200 in community)

Overall, the proposed project mainstreams and incorporates protection principles in the activities to promote meaningful access, safety and dignity. Despite the challenging environment, and thanks to its effective access strategy, AAH has full-access to the targeted areas and has the capacity in place to start the operations according to the work-plan set through direct-implementation.

Particular attention has been paid to ensure activities implemented by AAH are not a duplication of activities undertaken by other agencies in the area and complement activities from other actors.</narrative>
