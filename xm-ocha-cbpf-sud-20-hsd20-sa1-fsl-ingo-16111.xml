   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food Security and Livelihoods assistance to vulnerable host communities in El Salam locality, White Nile State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to provide basic lifesaving Food Security and Livelihoods (FSL) support to at least 15,000 people (about 3,000 HHs) in four villages/communities (El Radis 1, El Radis 2, Jouri and Um Sangor) in El Salam locality, White Nile State.
Affected population to be targeted by the project will be vulnerable host communities (HCs) members, with specific focus on Female Headed Households (FHH), People With Disability (PWD), families with members who are elderly, children under five and families worst affected by COVID-19 crisis. 

Key considerations will be made to ensure specific safety, privacy and security needs of women, girls, men, boys and people with special needs are addressed during delivery of project activities.
Project activities will specifically seek to provide and enable vulnerable HCs members access lifesaving FSL support, which will include provision of agricultural inputs (winter season seeds and tools through vouchers and DiNER Fairs) and services (training, and field extension services) provision of quality veterinary (vaccination and treatment) and extension services (training, and field extension services) provision of emergency livelihoods (restocking, fishing) start up packages (through vouchers) and activities (establishment of Saving and Internal Lending Committees - SILCs - trainings and networking) and cash for work (digging of drainage tunnels and soil silos in preparation of the rainy seasons). Community Pest Scouts (CPS) will be trained on identifications of nymphs, fall army worms and other common crop pests and diseases to strengthen community early warning systems and preparedness. The CPSs will also support on alerts such as floods during the agricultural season.

The project will integrate messages on COVID-19 and cholera/AWD (in view of the on-coming rains starting from July/August) infection, prevention and control during community awareness sessions and field extension services.
The project will be implemented for a period of ten months.
Expected project impact is improved household food security and sustainable livelihoods status of the vulnerable HCs members in the four target villages in El Salam locality.
Implementation of project activities will mainstream gender and persons with special needs&#x2019; priorities and participation. For instance, in provision of agricultural and veterinary inputs and services, provision of emergency livelihood start-up activities and packages, and cash-for-work, beneficiary identification and selection processes will involve women, girls, boys, men, and people with special needs processes of project planning, implementation and monitoring will also engage all categories and calibres of men, women, boys and girls to ensure their specific needs and preferences on safety, security, and privacy are considered. Trainings to be conducted in the project will provide specific inputs and devised to enhance women, girls, men, boy and people with special needs&apos; capacities, while ensuring all groups are adequately represented in the groups of trainees. All data will be age and gender segregated.
Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) has a well-established office in Kosti with sufficient qualified staff and facilities. Having implemented several projects is El Salam, El Jabalian, El Douiem, Kosti, and Rabak localities on FSL sector (and other sectors such as WASH, Protection, NFIs through emergency response and Education), CAFOD has strong understanding of community needs, and has developed deep community relations and connections in addressing those needs. In this project, CAFOD will partner with Sub-Sahara International Development Organization (SIDO), a national NGO which has an office in Kosti and is implementing projects in the proposed project locality. Project activities will be implemented by SIDO, with CAFOD Khartoum and Kosti offices providing project management and technical support.</narrative>
