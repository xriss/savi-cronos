   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Refugees in Informal Tented Settlements (ITSs) are at increased risk of contracting the Covid-19 disease due to the overcrowded context in which they live, combined with poor access to basic services, which challenges people&#x2019;s ability to apply public health measures such as social distancing, self-isolation and proper hand hygiene practices


During the Covid-19 crisis in Jordan, FPEC has been an active member in WASH Task Force and Working Groups and had contributed to the development of the Jordan COVID-19 WASH Sector Strategy.  Moreover, during the curfew FPEC has been working round the clock to protect refuges in ITSs from Covid-19 through the coordination and liaising with 60 ITSs which contain almost 8.000 Syrian refuges by adopting and implementing the developed strategy and its recommendations and activities, such as
1.	Cooperating with the established and trained WASH committees in each of the ITS (50% males, 50% females) and train them to do the hygiene awareness raising and risk communication and community engagement through disseminating the correct hygiene practices and communicating official instructions and messages about COVID

2.	Activating what&#x2019;s app group for all WASH committees to keep regular and close communication, disseminate awareness messages and videos sent by UNICEF and the government. Each WASH committee has established its what&#x2019;s app group for their ITS to ensure proper dissemination of information and avoid any rumors
3.	Using various media platforms to launch a massive dissemination campaign on handwashing and COVID-19 prevention messages to communities
4.	Ensuring access to clean water through distributing Aquatabs (water purification tablets) to improve water quality when needed
5.	Distributing WASH NFIs - Soaps, hygiene kits, menstrual hygiene kits, cleaning kits per family which has supported the hygiene practices, and 
6.	Distributing Cash for the WASH committees to motivate them to continue the close follow up during the curfew 

FPEC immediate access to 60 ITSs has been granted by the active partnership with UNICEF starting from 2017 providing ITSs with different types of services mainly WASH and health such as
-	The distribution and installation of an elevated mobile water tank with hand-washing facilities
-	The distribution and installation of mobile latrines
-	Ensuring access to safe drinking water including water testing, chlorination and cleaning of water tanks
-	Conducting hygiene promotion awareness and supplies provision including best practices on water storage and handling as well as conservation and water quality
-	The distribution of WASH kits, hygiene and cleaning kits
-	The establishment and training of WASH Committees in each of the ITSs these WASH committees were trained also on maintaining the water tanks and latrines and provided with needed tools, and 
-	Ensuring proper solid waste management

Access to safe drinking water is by far the most challenging in ITSs, with 46% ITS respondents without access to improved water supply according to the Multi-sectoral Rapid Needs Assessment. The situation in ITSs forms a particular concern due to high rates of open defecation and the limited access to safe water. FPEC aims under this proposal to continue the good work that have been managed to do so far to minimize the risk of WASH related diseases including Covid-19 in particular, to ensure the safety of refugees and their coping mechanism until this Epidemic is revealed in those (60) ITSs and include (15) new identified ITSs in Mafraq and Ramtha which are served by none and are in dire need for WASH services  

FPEC will target the total (75) ITSs and provide them with access to improved hygienic practices, hygiene promotion and delivery of hygienic products and services on a sustainable and equitable basis including risk communication and community engagement to help them to improve WASH services and face the Covid-19, while mainstreaming gender</narrative>
