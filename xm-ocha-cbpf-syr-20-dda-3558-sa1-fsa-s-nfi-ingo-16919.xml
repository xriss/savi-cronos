   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of multi-purpose cash assistance to vulnerable households in Rural Damascus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DRC is proposing to provide multipurpose cash assistance (MPCA) to 1,000 HHs (6,000 vulnerable individuals of six family average size) in the Rural Damascus Qudsiya sub-district to cover their basic needs.
According to the HNO 2020, Rural Damascus is one of the five Governorates with more IDPs and returnees and Qudisya is one of the sub-districts with higher food insecurity rates as stated by  the Food Sector. Only WFP, UNHCR and UNRWA are providing CVA in Qudisya and the accessibility to functioning markets and FSPs make the MPCA the most suitable intervention to address the basic needs of vulnerable HHs. The 1,000 HHs will be selected in coordination with the main NGOs working in the area as well as the local authorities among the most vulnerable and underserved populations. The target has been set based on the number of families in the waiting lists of WFP, the  capacity of the local markets and FSP, the project implementation timeframe, and the budget availability.


Based on the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) figure provided by the Cash Working Group(CWG) and harmonization efforts made with INGOs, DRC will provide 100,000 SYP cash assistance every month with a total of 600,000 SYP transferred per HH during the length of the response (6 payments of 100,000 SYP every month). DRC will aim to maintain harmonization with the agreed CWG rate. In case the CWG decides to change the transfer rate, during the project, DRC will communicate to SHF the proposed new rate before making any changes. It is expected that if the rate were to change it would coincide with a change in the FX rate and so would be able to be funded via a currency gain. 


The project will be implemented directly by DRC in Qudsiya, where has been present for 10 years and is already carrying out economic recovery interventions. This will allow DRC to target particularly HHs with compounding vulnerabilities, including those facing protection concerns and those with members who are socially and economically marginalized and in need of assistance, such as women-headed households, people with disabilities, and elderlies. The beneficiary selection will be coordinated with WFP, who is providing food assistance to the most vulnerable HHs in the area. WFP will share their beneficiary lists with DRC to avoid overlapping and to provide a coordinated response in the target area. 

DRC received written approval from MoSAL to implement cash-based interventions (CBI) on April 21st, 2020. Since then, DRC has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), beneficiary selection tools, and guidelines conducted a monthly risk analysis and provided training for national staff. DRC has also received approval to implement an MPCA project in Dara&#xB4;a that is currently ongoing through other funds.

DRC has signed a framework agreement with a financial service provider (FSP) and held several coordination meetings to confirm their capacity to absorb the caseload and their commitment to follow COVID-19 prevention measures and humanitarian principles</narrative>
