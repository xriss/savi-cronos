   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COVID-19: Cash Transfer Programme</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Diocese of Kenema is located along the Liberian border and is comprised of some of the most remote and rural communities in Sierra Leone. Poor infrastructure, especially during the rainy season, can often limit the movement of goods and services within these communities; negatively impacting upon their economic livelihoods. As a result, there is a need to support these vulnerable individuals with cash transfers through mobile money, allowing them to determine what goods or services best address their current needs in the midst of this outbreak. Given the characteristics of the target group, they are extremely susceptible to economic shocks and many are already suffering from income insecurity, worsened by the outbreak. A large proportion of these populations either depend on subsistence farming for their livelihoods, or petty trading especially for the vulnerable women. 


With the outbreak of COVID-19, a series of regulations have been imposed by the Government to control the spread of the virus across the Country. Some of these regulations like the inter-district lockdowns, periodic mandatory 3-day lockdowns, social distancing measures and night curfews, limit the movement of people and hampers their economic activities. This has resulted in further worsening of the vulnerability status of the already impoverished populations. 
The proposed action will provide the target groups with cash transfers through a mobile service provider for three months, to ensure that their basic needs can still be met. The project will also engage one volunteer per chiefdom, to assist in both spreading messaging about the importance of still seeking medical attention, for pregnant mothers and teenagers, as well as lactating mothers, PWDs and the elderly, and also encourage the participating beneficiaries to use the funds judiciously in order to ensure that their families are catered for at the end of the day.</narrative>
