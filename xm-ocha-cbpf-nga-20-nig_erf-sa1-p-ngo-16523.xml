   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance the well-being of conflict affected girls and boys in Madagali and Mubi South through Child Protection Service Provision.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CPPLI is proposing an 8-month project that aim to enhance the protection and well-being of children and conflict affected population in Madagali and Mubi South of Adamawa State. The project will be implemented in 2 communities through community-based approach that geared towards strengthening the child protection systems that support effective delivery of lifesaving Child Protection services in the targeted communities. The project specifically will: 


Promote access to comprehensive case management services of girls and boys facing protection risks: comprehensive case management services will be provided for children at risk of, or affected by, protection issues, including case management services for former CAAG and children with disabilities. Alternative care arrangements with prioritization of family-based solutions will be provided to children deprived of parental care, or whose parental care is accessed as inadequate. CPPLI will respond to the needs of unaccompanied and separated children through family tracing activities with the view to the best interest of the child. Referral of vulnerable children to access inter-sectoral and other specialized services will be facilitated through coordination with other humanitarian actors including NFI and WASH, health, livelihood, nutrition etc. CPPLI will recruit 4 community-based case workers (2 caseworkers per community: 1 male and 1 female) to ensure comprehensive case management services. Case management must meet the inter-agency standard and be conducted with strict adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures such as respiratory hygiene and physical distancing based on NCDC and WHO guidelines. However, our case management is targeted to reach 350 children where 20 are reunified with their families, 60 placed under alternative care arrangements, 240 children and 30 children with disabilities access specialized services. 


Enhance the well-being of conflict affected children, adolescents and caregivers through provision of quality psychosocial support services and information on child care and protection: through coordination with the existing Community Based Mechanisms e.g PTA (Parent Teachers Association) SBMCs (School-Based Management Committees) and CBCPCs (Community-Based Child Protection Committees), mobile Child Friendly Spaces will be established to provide age-specific creative, recreational and friendly social activities for children including adolescents. The adolescent girls and boys participating in the CFS will benefit from life skills education to build their decision making skills, competencies, self-confidence, negotiation skills and prevent violence, exploitation and abuse. However, 20 CFS facilitators (10 males and 10 females) will be engaged and train to facilitate CFS sessions and CFS is expected to reach 3000 children. The facilitators will ensure child friendly indoor activities such as puzzles, traditional games and songs, story telling that support the cognitive development of children and outdoor games that support psycho-motor development.  Positive parenting sessions for caregivers of vulnerable children/vulnerable caregivers will be established targeting 120 caregivers and in coordination with CPSS, positive parenting module will be adopted for the parenting lessons. Awareness raising at community levels on prevailing Child Protection issues including COVID-19 risks and prevention targeting children, caregivers, community stakeholders, local leaders, religious leaders, traditional rulers and the wider community members will be provided to 7000 beneficiaries. Also, culturally appropriate child friendly messaging IEC materials on COVID-19 risk and prevention will be developed targeting 1500 children. CPPLI recognizes the risks to children and other beneficiaries posed by COVID-19 and will ensure that all activities are done in line with the NCDC and WHO guidelines as no gathering of more than 10-15 people will be allowed.</narrative>
