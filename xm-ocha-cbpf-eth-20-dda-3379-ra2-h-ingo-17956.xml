   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps (IMC) is an US-registered independent affiliate organization of International Medical Corps UK (IMC (UK)), with which IMC (UK) shares the same name and charitable objectives and mission. IMC (UK) and IMC work together to deliver assistance programs in an accountable and effective manner in pursuit of their commonly held charitable objectives. IMC (UK) will engage IMC to implement its programmes in the field, with IMC (UK) oversight, according to the terms and conditions of any agreement that results from this proposal and the terms of the parties&#x2019; administrative service agreement. IMC maintains a branch office in Croatia, IMC Split that provides administrative and operational support to IMC (UK) and to the programmes on the ground, including but not limited to financial management, procurement management/international procurements, and logistics. 


The purpose of this project is to contribute to the emergency response of the Tigray crisis thought establishing mobile health and nutrition teams (MHNT) in three conflict affected woredas in West Tigray. The current armed conflict in Tigray, coupled with pre-existing poverty and natural disasters, has created major stress and vulnerability. 


Thousands of people in Tigray region are feared displaced and some reportedly injured, while many are without access to basic assistance due to interruption of trade and transfers, insecurity, lack of communication and lack of fuel and cash to access markets. Verification of needs remains a challenge due to a communication blackout and lack of access to the region. According to UNOCHA situation report, on December 7, 2020 the humanitarian situation in Tigray continues to deteriorate rapidly, and humanitarian needs have reportedly further increased following the recent clashes in the capital Mekelle . 
With the current situation in Tigray now lasting nearly a month, it is likely that all basic services, including health care are extremely affected and struggling to provide daily services. It is also implied that health facilities may be affected or partially destroyed due to conflict, which may prevent them from providing the full package of primary health care services.  The status of COVID-19 cases before interruption of communication was around 6,655 according to the Ethiopian Public Health Institute epidemiological report. It is expected that with the current emergency transmission of COVID-19 is also exacerbated due to the possible interruption of COVID-19 prevention and control activities which is another humanitarian concern. 

To respond to this crisis and to provide lifesaving activities, IMC has select priority activities that would respond the emergency health and nutrition needs in three woredas (Kafta Humera, Wolkayit and Tegede) of Western Tigray. 

The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of morbidity and mortality as a result of poor access to essential Nutrition and Primary Health Care services through integrating COVID-19 prevention in Western part of Tigray region. To realize the required support, the existing PHCs support will be provided with surge staff and MHNT deployed for the outreach service which is going to have an important role to play to improve the access to essential health care services for vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host communities.  This can result in improved access to health and nutrition service and reduction in morbidity and mortality.  The project have three outcomes a) improved health service access and status of IDPs, Returnees and affected host communities living in the 3 woredas of Western Tigray zone of Tigray region for preventive and curative health and nutrition services b) Improved preparedness and response to epidemic prone disease outbreaks including COVID-19 in the targeted woredas of West Tigray c) Improved quality care for people with physical injuries, disabilities and Mental Health Psychosocial support needs.</narrative>
