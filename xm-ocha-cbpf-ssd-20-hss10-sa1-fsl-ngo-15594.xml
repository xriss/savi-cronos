   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to effectively and efficiently enable the nexus between recovery, restoration and development thus contribute to the protection and rehabilitation of livelihoods of the most vulnerable and affected population (7,100 HHs= 42,600 individuals) in Maiwut County (Jotama Payam, Olang Payam and Kigila Payam), Upper Nile State. The project is a twelve months project targeting 7100 HHs of vulnerable IDPs, returnees, refugees, and host communities designed to make use of the windows of opportunity for targeted population that missed the cropping season either due to conflict or no access to humanitarian assistance. Of these 7100 HH (all receiving the assorted lifesaving kits- vegetable, fishing kits ad crop kits), 2,150 will be male headed HHS, 3,000 will be female headed HHs whereas 1250 will be boy child headed HHs and 700 will be girl child headed HHs. Among these, RuCAPD will be targeting 710 persons with disability. On the same note,  the host community will be: 860 M headed HH, 1200 W headed HH, 500 B headed HHs and 280G headed HHs IDPs will be at 387 M headed HHs, 540W headed HHs,  225 B headed HHs and 126 G headed HHsreturnees will be: 860 M headed HH, 1200 W headed HH, 500 B headed HHs and 280G headed HHs Refugees - 43 M headed HH, 60 W headed HH, 25 B headed HHs and 14G headed HHs. 168 persons with disability: 78 men,46 women, 17 boys and 27 girls. It is consistent with the FSL allocation both in terms of the Priority, Geographical scope, and the seasonality of the activities. The major livelihood activities in the selected area for response is agriculture (vegetable, crop and fishing). 
The targeting will be done with gender lens and consideration of incorporation of Accountability to affected population. The program implementation will ensure that Do No Harm principle is adhered to as transparency and accountability to the affected population is placed right at the center of beneficiary targeting and provision of support. RuCAPD extensive presence and history in Upper Nile coupled with an in-depth understanding of the community conflict dynamics and tailored approaches to specific communities will mitigate risk and reduce any potential negative impacts of the project as well as any protection issues.

It is important to note that despite the peace, the effects of the protracted conflict with underlying factors like multiple displacement, destruction of basic infrastructure like hospitals, loss of food production systems, destruction of livelihoods as well as protection issues this intervention is key. 
The project will be contributing to the closing of the Jan-Dec 2020 cereal deficit which CFSAM estimates at 482500 MT.

COVID-19 possess a new challenge which RuCAPD is awake to. We will follow the laid down guidelines by WHO and the MOH and the HLTF in handling this pandemic as we also disseminate safety precautions to the community. RuCAPD will adhere to the distribution guidelines by FAO.
The project will receive pipeline supplies from FAO whilst the requested funding from SSHF will be used to provide for front line services. The project will use direct distribution to the targeted groups through a transparent process of identification and distribution. In case of security hitches, RUCAPD has extensive network of how to reach the targeted beneficiaries. RuCAPD will use the Community Based Targeting strategy. Together, we will identify the most vulnerable members through a participatory process- communities because have a better understanding of their own vulnerability than external actors. This is in line with our objective of sustainable livelihoods as the people actively engage in issues affecting their lives. The five targeting principles will apply: Equity, adequacy, efficiency, transparency and equality.</narrative>
