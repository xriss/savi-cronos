Each beneficiary household will receive stove and diesel for 3 months based on 4 liter per day, Total 360 liter, the diesel will be packed in jerrycans, (Heaters, Diesel, and jerrycans specifications are attached to the proposal (Attachment T 01)

Binaa will distribute 3 patches of fuel, the first one (120 liters) will be in December 2020 and it will be conjugated with stoves distribution, the second one (120 liters) will be in January 2021, and third one (120 liters) will be in February 2021, according to the time plan of the project (Attachment A 01).
The distribution will be in kind at the main distribution points and the quality of the diesel will be checked before distribution, however, the fuel kits will be delivered to the elderly (over 60 years old), people with special needs, and the people who are unable to reach the distribution point for any reason directly to their house (door to door) that will decrease the risk of COVID 19 on the elderly people.
Verification visits (100% of beneficiaries) will be conducted after each distribution to ensure that the beneficiaries are still available to receive the next batch and ensure that they are using the heaters and fuel.
Binaa will follow the SNFI recommended procedures for the distributing of NFIs during COVID-19 in addition to follow Binaa guidance in this regard (Attachment A 02), the following are some of these procedures:
	Preventive measures will be taken to ensure social separation and availability of enough area, that will reduce the risk of spreading of COVID-19, the plan for the distribution point which will be equipped with cones and plastic chains to regulate the entry and exit process is attached to the proposal (Attachment T 03).
	The team will share the distribution plan with the camp management and will inform the beneficiaries a day before the distribution process, and the beneficiaries will be divided into groups to ensure less gathering of the people, however, cards will be given to each beneficiary with the time and date of receipt.
	Beneficiaries will be advised to leave the distribution location moment they receive assistance, they will not pass through the distribution point more than once.
	Binaa will distribute masks to the beneficiaries HHs (5 for each one) as per SNFI guidance for COVID 19, that will be done with each fuel distribution.
Awareness sessions will come along with verification/distribution activities , these awareness sessions will focus on  2 main topics, 1- the best procedures for dealing with fires, 2- COVID-19 awareness (following proper hygiene practices, Covid-19 spread, pandemic symptoms, and the ways to deal with it in case of getting the disease),  beneficiaries will be provided with the numbers of emergency/actors that can deal with the cases, (the list is attached to the proposal (Attachment A 03)).</narrative>
