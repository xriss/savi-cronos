   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing and promoting primary and secondary health care services to the most vulnerable groups and areas in Aleppo  its countryside</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The country is still living in a difficult stage under the current conditions, especially in light of the difficult economic conditions, poor living, high prices and the difficulty in providing primary and secondary health care services, and this requires providing a response to this, especially for the most vulnerable populations such as (the elderly, women, persons with disabilities, and the returnees ...) especially in the rural areas of Aleppo, noting the recent rise in the newly infected people with corona virus (COVID 19) in the country, and this is a burden and a challenge for people.
This project aims to strengthen the health sector in the countryside of Aleppo by providing primary and secondary health care services and to increase the access of health services to hard-to-reach areas through mobile medical clinics for the most vulnerable areas and social groups in coordination with Aleppo Health Directorate.

The medical services that will be provided are providing health care services to about 23000 beneficiaries (in Aleppo amp its countryside) by two mobile clinics that have been pre-equipped with SHF funding with medical devices such as: ECG, Echograghy, portable X-Ray device.
They include four medical specialties: internal clinic, gynecological clinic, pediatric clinic, and orthopedic clinic.

In addition to having a highly qualified medical staff to deal with patients, and have previous experience working within mobile medical teams.
Thus equipped mobile clinics will give us a quick start in providing primary health care services, in addition to reduce the movement of beneficiaries between the countryside and the city, and thus enhance the role of social divergence to reduce COVID-19 pandemic.

The medical services that will be provided are:
1) Primary health care services:
	Providing patients with drugs and medical analysis.
	Awareness sessions and psychological support  for the beneficiaries (such as: Corona virus).
	Investigations: ECHO, ECG, X-Ray.
	Wheelchairs for the disabled.
	Hearing Aids.
	Medical Glasses....
2) Secondary health care services, such as:
	Deliveries.
	General surgeries.
	Orthopedic operations.
	Gynecological operations.
	Urinary surgeries...
Through the system of referrals from the countryside to the city to implement the required action.

The areas were carefully selected in coordination with Aleppo Health Directorate and WHO, where Aleppo Health Directorate indicated to us that the health services in these areas are insufficient and the areas urgently need the medical services that were set in the project proposal (especially radiography and analyses...), noting that there are some health centers in those areas, but only provide vaccination services for children.
As for the criteria to be used in selecting regions:
The criteria used for selecting areas were based on the priorities of Aleppo Health Directorate in terms of the areas most in need of providing medical services? and according to the following criteria:
 The absence of hospitals to provide secondary health care services, such as surgeries and others.
 The lack of pharmacies in the targeted areas.
 The lack of sufficiently specialized medical clinics to provide inspections and investigations.
 Population groups in those areas are among the most vulnerable groups.</narrative>
