  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the start of the COVID19 pandemic, there have been about 50 million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 1.2 million deaths. These numbers have started to surge in many countries of what is called as a second wave. Meanwhile in Syria, the first case of COVID19 in the northwest was reported in July and it had been increasing slightly before it started to surge in mid of September. 


The overall objective of this project is to reduce mortality and morbidity of the affected population, aiming to provide COVID19 primary healthcare service through supporting two existing community-based isolation centres in Maart Tamsrin (CCTC-21) and Salqin (CCTC_24) and establishing one centre in Al-Bab city with an approximate coverage population of 300,000-200,000 inhabitants in each location. 


The three community COVID19 centres (CCTCs) have the capacity to provide medical assessment, monitoring, and support therapy for the confirmed cases with mild symptoms. The CCTC aims to reduce the burden of the caseload at the overwhelmed hospital case and facilitate immediate COVID-19 testing through ACU partner meanwhile the CCTC will continue providing supportive therapy for suspected and confirmed cases admitted in Centre. In addition, these CCTCs play the intermediate role of  \ a stabilization moderate case without medical complication and facilitate referral case required hospitalization, while received stable cases at recovery stage from the hospital ready to be received at CCTC in order to minimize at caseload at the hospital level.  Operationally the CCTC divided into three functioning areas this including: 
-	Observation area defined for highly suspected cases/ contact developed symptoms and undergoing laboratory confirmation test and provision of basic supportive therapy.
-	Isolation and case management area runs by health workers to provide medical assessment and supportive therapy to confirm COVID-19 infected mild cases.
-	Recovery area to accommodate the cases under medical supervision until the COVID-19 laboratory test converted to negative. After that, the final assessment and preparation for discharge will be conducted for the cases. 

The specific objectives for this project are:
-	To reduce the spread of the COVID-19 infection in the area of Maart Tamsrin, Salqin and Al-Baba
-	To manage the suspected COVID-19 patients and provide community-based isolation service for the suspected and the confirmed cases. 
-	To provide medical consultation, oxygen therapy, and drugs for COVID-19 cases.

Main activities: 
-	Procurement and provision of medicines, consumables medical supplies including the personal protective equipment, logistics supplies, cleaning material and stationery, waste management, maintenance, fuel, other supplies essential for the facility to function and provide standard quality health services.
-	Recruitment of the professional management and medical staff required to manage the CCTCs&#x2019; implementation activities (10 medical doctors, 30 nurses, 100+ essential staff support for 3 CCTs) 
-	Establishing one CCTC in Al-Bab including WASH infrastructure and the in-patient wards buildings. while this centre is completed, the staff will be working in a temporary facility rehabbed by WATAN in Al-Bab to be able to start the activities in the first month of the project.
-	Operate the CCTCs (Maart Masrin, Salqin, AlBab) with full services (case management, isolation for the suspected and confirmed cases, oxygen therapy, supportive treatment) This will be under direct supervision, to ensure the quality of the healthcare services based on WHO standard guidelines and treatment protocols.
-	Coordinating with the ACU team to facilitate the sample collection in the centre. 

Name of the facilities and type of support and HeRMS Code:  
-	Maart Tamsrin CCTC. (CCTC-21)
-	Salqin CCTC. (CCTC-24)
