   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SAWA.1 (Supporting the Affected With Assistance) Provision of Multi-Purpose Cash Assistance (MPCA) to 255 IDPs, returnees and host communities in Iraq-Hawija</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project targets 255 HH of highly vulnerable returnees, IDP&#x2019;s and host community members living in and around Hawija centre/Kirkuk with Multi-Purpose Cash Assistance (MPCA).The most vulnerable individuals will be selected using the CWG&#x2019;s SEVAT tool, taking into consideration, the negative impact of COVID-19 outbreak and its subsequent containment measures, in disruption financial services with immediate and long-term economic consequences.
255 conflict-affected households (153 female headed households, and 102 male) will directly receive a one-off payment of MPCA for the amount of USD $800 to meet critical basic needs and reduce negative coping strategies in conflict-affected out-of-camp communities in   Kirkuk, filling gaps in service   provision such as the absence of NGOs like Tearfund who was covering this needs in previous times . This will support households by giving them the choice in how to spend the MPCA and respecting their dignity. The one-off payment will be distributed through the international Hawala agency to avoid complications of liquidity. Such assistance will be delivered in conflict-affected communities in Kirkuk in areas where markets are functioning, accessible, and safe delivery of cash will be possible  .

Without access to hard currency due to the liquidity crisis, a decline in purchasing power due to inflation, and low or no income available to meet their basic needs, vulnerable households suffer the most from the effects of the protracted crisis, increasing their reliance on negative coping mechanisms and exposure to protection threats.
A rapid needs assessment (RNA) in May 2020 has identified locations for the intervention (Shubat, Salam, and Nasr neighborhoods), as well as having identified areas where other actors will no longer be implementing  , meaning that the consortium partners will be able to fill this much needed gap, and that&#x2019;s why we have coordinated well with Kirkuk livelihoods Sub cluster, community members, the CWG,CCI members, Hawala agencies and others to understand the need and the possibilities of covering the gaps.

A further RNA conducted by IRC in Kirkuk in May 2020, highlighted the needs in their communities for humanitarian assistance, especially cash, for vulnerable families who have been impacted by their inability to access sufficient food and/or cash.
 The targeted households will be assessed using the Socio-Economic Vulnerability Assessment Tool (SEVAT) as provided by the Cash Working Group. This intervention is building towards the HRP 2020 SO2 Critical problems related to living standards.
POINT will use a community-based approach by establishing a community committee to allow the communities to feed into the design and implementation of the project. They will steer the delivery of the project as well as establish community buy-in for the project.
The Consortium partners&#x2019; staff will implement the project activities together, where  POINT will take the role of the Lead Parther and   it will support local partner, AlGhad, through empowering their organizational abilities so they can implement this project in the best way, So,this project will directly target 255 households, 153 or 60% of the households will be female-headed, and 102 will be male-headed households. With the average household size of 6, this makes the total direct beneficiary reach approximately 1530. From the rapid need assessments in the chosen neighborhoods in Hawija, Kirkuk, this project will directly target approximately 382
men (25%), 536 women (35%), 275 boys (18%), and 337 girls (22%). 1530 beneficiaries.</narrative>
