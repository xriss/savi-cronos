   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent support for returnees affected by the Covid-19 and the protracted crisis in Al-Ghab region/Hama governorate to improve their food and nutrition security through livelihoods restoration.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AlGhab region which is part of Hama governorate is composed of three districts (Muhardeh, As-Squielbieh, Mesiaf). These districts were affected by the protracted crisis in various levels. FAO is proposing to improve food and nutrition security of 5,750 returnee families affected in Muhardeh district. The district of Muhardeh was the most affected in the region due to the challenging and complex security situation and its proximity to a previous intense military operation area. Since the crisis erupted, at least 60% of the population in Muhardeh district were affected. In some villages, rural households were displaced several times. With an improvement of the security situation, some families are returning to their original villages. Though barriers to return still exist, an estimated 50% of the displaced population have actually returned to their lands but they need support to rebuild their livelihood. 


The main income source for rural families is agriculture (crops and livestock) and marketing of agricultural products. This means that to assist returnees achieve household-level food and nutrition security, it is important to support them through agriculture-based livelihoods restoration. In a study conducted by FAO in 2020 (Al-Ghab baseline), about 50% of people in Al-Ghab region (including Muhardeh) have reported that the main difficulty they are facing is the lack of access to good quality and price increase of inputs due to the exchange rate fluctuations and closure of the borders due to Covid-19 related restrictive measures. Another 34% of the people in the region have reported that they had to stop summer crop production due to lack of water access mainly caused by the damage / destruction of main and field irrigation networks, and the destruction to the wells in the region particularly in Muhardeh. Moreover, livestock numbers in Muhardeh has dropped significantly by 26% since the beginning of the crisis.


FAO is therefore proposing a 12-months intervention in Muhardeh district , which will target 5,750 households (34,500 individuals) through quick-impact activities, which will support wheat and livestock production coupled with the rehabilitation of field irrigation networks and systems. The wheat production component will target 3,250 returnee households through provision of quality wheat seed and support with land preparation the livestock production component will target 1,500 returnee households and IDPs through distribution of animal feed. To address the water challenges, FAO proposes to rehabilitate essential irrigation infrastructure to restore 800 hectares of irrigable land, which will benefit 1,000 households. In selecting Muhardeh for this proposed intervention, FAO has taken into account the prevalence of food insecurity among returnees as a result of constraints related to lack of access to crop production inputs, livestock feed and water for crop production. The area was also prioritized within the Standard Allocation Strategy Paper and coordination has been done within the food and agriculture sector (FAS) and with the Early Recovery and Livelihoods (ERL) sector to ensure that there is no duplication and overlap.</narrative>
