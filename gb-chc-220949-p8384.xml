  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The explosion at the Port of Beirut at 6:10pm on Tuesday 4th August 2020 caused extensive damage, loss of life and has impacted hundreds of thousands of people in Beirut. As of 25th September, over 190 people are reported to have died, with more than 6,500 people injured. The Government of Lebanon estimates that around 300,000 people were made homeless following the Beirut Port explosion and up to 40,000 buildings sustained damage.
The explosion occurred while Lebanon faces a deep economic and political crisis, and rising COVID-19 cases. Protests against the Lebanese government have been taking place for months in Beirut prompting the Government to step down on 10 August 2020. Poverty has risen in recent months; 2.7 million residents are now poor and 1.1. million are extremely poor.
The Lebanese Red Cross immediately mobilized its teams and assets to respond to the blast. They have launched a one-year Response Plan appealing for $125 million to respond to the needs of those affected by the multiple overlapping shocks faced by many in Lebanon during 2020.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Dear all,
Please see attached the addendum for your approval. This &#xC2;&#xA3;15,000 ($20,420) allocation from EBRC is attached to this grant. Therefore, Addendum 2 is for the agreement of the grant expenditure to back be dated to August as per LRCS request. The previous agreed grant extension end date of 12.04.2021 will be further extended to 12.05.2021 due to the implications of the COVID19 pandemic and not being able to finalise tenders with suppliers and the additional funds of &#xC2;&#xA3;15,000 $20,420 aligned to this grant. This will allow LRC 3 months to spend the remaining funds under this grant.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Please see attached the GAD addendum 1 and supporting documentation including the bank details for the DF allocation to the DMU of LRC in response to the Beirut explosion.&#xC2;&#xA0;
On 4 August a large explosion occurred in the port of Beirut, killing over 170 people and injuring an estimated 6,000. A number of sectors of Greater Beirut have been significantly affected by the blast - businesses and infrastructure have been destroyed or damaged, and up to 300,000 people are thought to have lost their homes.
The Disaster Management Sector at the Lebanese Red Cross will be providing a several tier response with both direct response to the blast in coordination with Blood Transfusion services and long-term objectives to improve the living conditions of the affected population through the provision of&#xC2;&#xA0;&#xC2;&#xA0;shelters and basic needs to 10,000 families in a three months response through 3 phases:
Phase one: Conduct a Post Disaster Assessment (PDA) followed by a door-to-door emergency needs assessment and Damage Assessment and Needs Analysis (DANA) accompanied with distribution of ready-made meals and water
Phase two: Provision of food parcels, hygiene kits and shelter-improvement kits for eligible families affected by the explosion.
Phase three: Facilitation of a long-term suitable shelter solution through the modalities seen as fit (e.g. Cash and Shelter equipment)
&#xC2;&#xA0;
&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#xA2;Direct Response in Coordination with BTS: Activating hotlines for receiving shelter requests, filing for Restoring Family Links (RFL) cases.
&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#xA2;Supporting Blood Transfusion Services with logistic services, management of blood donation.
&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#xA2;Processing, and transportation of blood units to hospitals throughout the emergency response.
&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#xA2;Supporting the expansion, installation, and maintenance of two LRC field operation points.
&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#xA2;Provision of logistical support for LRC staff and volunteers throughout the operation
Due to sending these original funds to the wrong account, this was reimbursed back to the BRC. It was agreed with finance that we would;

Amend the grant total to include the amount we need to send out&#xC2;&#xA0;
Include the changed amount in an addendum explaining what happened- see documents&#xC2;&#xA0;
Create a new payment with the right bank details and send for approval

This will mean two payments will appear in PIMS for the same amount and so it will look like we have overpaid on the project, we have not. This information is also reflected in the decision log, along with&#xC2;&#xA0;a copy of the Agresso transactions&#xC2;&#xA0;that shows that grant going out and the credit coming back in against the PCode for the returned grant.&#xC2;&#xA0;As PIMS&#xC2;&#xA0;can&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t register reimbursements&#xC2;&#xA0;the grant will be overdrawn in PIMS but not in the Agresso.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Dear Rachel and Jason,
Please see attached the GAD for the &#xC2;&#xA3;2million FCDO funds and all supporting documentation. The&#xC2;&#xA0;&#xC2;&#xA0;support of &#xC2;&#xA3;2 million funds ($2,617,620.50) for LRC will be divided between the four units, Disaster Management (DM) $1milllion ($975,000 of which will be sent to LRC and $25,000 which BRC will procure on LRCs behalf), Emergency Medical Services (EMS) $1million ($740,619.05 of which will be sent to LRC and $259,380.95 which BRC will procure on LRCs behalf),&#xC2;&#xA0; Blood Transfusion services (BTS) $267,620.75 and their Logistics services and equipment $249,999.75.&#xC2;&#xA0;
Under this GAD as we will be procuring on behalf of LRC as well as transferring funds; the full amount we will transfer to LRC is $2,333,239.55 and we, BRC, will procure $284,380.95 worth of PPE and consumables and medical consumables on behalf of LRC. We are covering any CTC costs from the appeal funds as discussed in the first MPB. Jason for your reference I have also attached the most up to date risk register.&#xC2;&#xA0;We are sending two tranches of 50%, we will send the second tranche when at least 80% of the first tranche has been spent.&#xC2;&#xA0;
&#xC2;&#xA0;
The LRC filled in their own bank details. Please can I ask you to sign this off as soon as possible. 
Best wishes, 
Amy</narrative>
