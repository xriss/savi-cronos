   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Upon request from the UN Special Representative for Ebola Response and the UN Resident Coordinator in Liberia, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) deployed a UN Disaster And Coordination (UNDAC) team to Monrovia. The aim of the UNDAC team was to support the establishment of the national coordination platform and the optimization of coordination functions, critical for a timely and efficient response to the Ebola epidemic in Monrovia. As part of the UNDAC response, Danish Emergency Management Agency (DEMA), through and in cooperation with the International Humanitarian Partnership (IHP), was requested to support the efforts of the UNDAC team. To enable establishment of an on-site operations and coordination centre (OSOCC), OCHA requested IHP to deploy a team of three IT and telecommunication (ICT) experts and two persons supporting information management (IM) and logistics. Furthermore an ICT equipment module was requested. The module needed to contain extra printing capacity in order to facilitate UNDAC information management efforts and was also required to produce larger geographical maps. The requested period of support was initially 4 weeks. The base of operation was situated in Monrovia, but with the possibility of additional travels throughout the country with the purpose of supporting monitoring and data collection efforts.</narrative>
