2.1) 1 blog post, 3 press realeses 
2.2) 16 solutions were presented to the government counterparts for further consideration.  
2.3) The team has reached a 5% proportion that increases the uptake of the innovation methods included in the AccLab Network suite.
2.4) The AccLab started working together with four programme advisors to incorporates its methodologies through ongoing projects. 

Output 3: A core global level result will be that a global learning and scaling network is established and functioning.
3.1) The lab interacts with other labs through formal and informal channels. 
3.2) The lab has exceeded the expectation of sharing 5% of the methodologies and other opportunities across the network.  
3.3) Total reach in social media 132800 
3.4) The AccLab members have been actively driving the conversation in the innovation ecosystem. As evidenced by the participation in women in STEM events in Poland, the interviews in the largest learning network Ekinchi.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Output 1: UNDP Country Offices and partners will have increased capability for scanning, sensemaking and experimentation for sustainable development solutions in 60 developing countries.
1.1 &amp; 1.2.) 5 new data sources per lab 6 different data sources per lab.  The AccLab introduced various data sources including primary data collection. The findings and insights were reflected in the following reports &#x201C;Human-Centred smart Cities: Inclusion&#x201D;, &#x201C;Rapid Impact Assessment of COVID-19 on Beneficiaries&#x201D;, &#x201C;Rapid Assessment of Digital Economy&#x201D;, &#x201C;The Future of Work: Risks and Opportunities Through Eyes of RBEC Accelerator Lab&#x201D;, &#x201C;Plastic Pollution in Sumqayit&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Impact of COVID-19 on the Private Sector&#x201D; together with the CO.
1.3)  53 solutions have been collected on the topics such as COVID-19 and water-related challenges. Moreover, 200 recycling solutions have been submitted through the OzunYarat platform, which has been set to promote upcycling in the country.
1.4) To achieve the results, the Accelerator Lab introduced several tools such as a  crowdsourcing platform, co-designing, hackathon, collective intelligence, and prototyping. 

Output 2: New sustainable development solutions will be scaled at country level as part of UNDP&#x2019;s country programme and operations, national policy and/or local markets.
2.1) 10 blogs and 13 press releases
2.2) 53 solutions have been presented to the government. 
2.3) The uptake of the designed solutions by the government was high. 8 out of 8 healthcare-related prototypes were further managed by the Ministry of Health. Moreover, the Ministry of Transport, Communications, and High Technologies have co-designed and scaled up the one-stop digital platform with all e-services available in Azerbaijan during COVID-19.
2.4)  Almost all new projects designed by the CO were prepared together with the AccLab, which exceeds the target of 15% CO programming influenced by the AccLab Network. The team has been working closely with the UNDP programme advisors in designing and implementing projects by mainstreaming digital transformation. Those are &quot;Vocational Education Programme&quot;, &quot;COVID-19 Rapid Response Facility&quot;, &quot;SDG Joint Programme&quot;, &quot;EU Capacity Building of CSOs and Promoting of the Social Entrepreneurship&quot;, &quot;Addressing GBV through comprehensive and coordinated community effort&quot;, &quot;EU4Lankaran&quot;,  and &#x201C;Enabling A Disability-Centered Approach To Covid-19 Recovery In Azerbaijan&#x201D;.

Output 3: A core global level result will be that a global learning and scaling network is established and functioning.
3.1) The lab interacts with other labs through formal and informal channels. On top of that, the Head of Exploration organized and run the AccLab Explorer call and Steering Committee of the Explorer Global Summit. 
3.2) The lab has exceeded the expectation of sharing 5% of the methodologies and other opportunities across the network.  The Head of Experimentation together with the other colleagues across the region was a part of the organizing team of the Istanbul Innovation Days. Moreover, one of the solutions designed by the AccLab team has been replicated by the UNDP CO in the Maldives.
3.3) Total reach on social media 402570; reach of Ozun Yarat platform 170,000 visitors
3.4) The AccLab members have been actively driving the conversation in the innovation ecosystem by participating in over 10 innovation-themed events including iclimathon in Pakistan.  The AccLab has been leading the preparation and implementation of the Innoweek, which aims to spread innovative ideas in our country, expand the startup movement, develop innovative thinking among young people. Furthermore, to connect ecosystem players and facilitate joint efforts and innovative solutions to tackle the challenge, #STEMhamiuchundur (#STEMisforeveryone) has started to encourage more young women and girls to advance in STEM fields.  

NOTE: The AccLab team has been implementing or completed 14 initiatives on employment, social services, e-healthcare, green solutions, and gender equality. Although AccLab has been heavily focused on the pandemic response, 21% of the initiatives were exploring areas outside the ongoing COVID-19 response. The team has contributed towards seven SDGs such as SDG 3 on good health, SDG 5 on gender equality, SDG 6 on clean water, SDG 8 on economic growth, SDG 9 on innovation, SDG 12 on responsible consumption, and SDG 13 on climate action.</narrative>
