   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On the past 30 March 2020, the first state of emergency was declared in Mozambique in response to the first cases of infection in the country. The economic instability associated to this situation pushed thousands of people,  with no means to survive, to embrace informal commercial activities, estimating that only in the city of Maputo, between 25,000 and 30,000 people practice this kind of activity. According to the register of vendors at least 22,000 vendors carry out their activities in the markets, some of which are highly congested, making them a real potential focus for the spread of COVID-19. Urgent measures must therefore be taken to mitigate the possible impacts of a rapid dissemination of the Coronavirus in the markets as well as in the neighborhoods surrounding formal and informal shopping centers.
On the one hand, there are in the neighborhoods and markets high numbers of children and women in vulnerable situations at risk of contamination as they try to sustain their lives through commercial exchanges in the markets and on the streets. 
Despite the context, fairs and markets continue to operate normally.  At the same time, it is urgent to have an intervention plan to reduce the health risk of sellers, as well as users, in order to minimize COVID-19 impact on this group of people exercising this informal commercial activity in the neighbourhoods and in the Xipamanine market.</narrative>
