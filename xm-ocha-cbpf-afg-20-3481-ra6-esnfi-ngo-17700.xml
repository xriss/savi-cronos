   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of immediate winterization assistance to people in need in high priority location of Khost province.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CAHPO&#x2019;s proposed intervention is an emergency delivery measure intended to ensure a timely and effective response to humanitarian needs arising from conflicts, natural disasters, and other emergencies in the south-eastern region of Afghanistan (Khost province with is the 2nd priority in the winterization strategy). The intervention will focus on meeting the urgent humanitarian needs of internally displaced people and families within the targeted provinces of Khost as well as those fleeing to this province to seek shelter from outstanding challenges in adjacent provinces.  
Through implementation of the proposed project, CAHPO intended to support 1,135 affected families in Khost province to save their lives through provision of winterization support such as heating fuel/gas, winter clothing and blankets.  CAHPO targets a total of 7,945 beneficiaries (2,660 individuals in Gurbaz district, 2,730 in Tanay district and 2,555 individuals in Nadirshakot district) for all three types of activities such as Winter Clothing, Blankets and heating materials. The number of beneficiaries for each type of activity will be determined based on the initial assessment in these three districts. CAHPO will determined the type of heating materials (Gas stove, fuel/gas) based on the findings from the assessment in each location with USD 200 per family.
Providing heating support in kind is more favorable for many vulnerable families such as disabled or female-headed families in the target areas. Moreover, in-kind heating can be valuable for filing a winterization gap at a crucial time (without spending time by families to buy and transfer heating items). CAHPO will contract at the nearest possible level to distribute/provide the heating materials to the selected families. 
CAHPO will conduct an assessment to identify the needs of selected beneficiary for the mentioned assistances with a proper categorization for heating stove with fuel/gas, clothes and blankets. CAHPO will ensure that the most vulnerable people in need are prioritized for the winterization using selected criteria, including female-headed household child-headed household disabled headed household elderly headed household very large family (8 members or more) very poor families families with chronically- ill members or having other pressing vulnerability. The winterization items will be procured under the supervision of committee and will be delivered to identified beneficiaries by the distribution committee. CAHPO will properly coordinate the implementation process with all actors in the area as it was coordinated in the planning stage. A post-distribution monitoring will be conducted with a sample of beneficiary households. Furthermore, CAHPO will ensure that any negative impact that the project could have on women, men and children will be timely identified and addressed by the project team. 
The proposed activities and locations were coordinated through relevant ESNFI and AHF partners during the concept note submission to avoid duplication of services. Coordination will be continued throughout the project cycle at various levels. CAHPO has a presence in Khost since 2013 and implemented projects in past and created active social networks among the community for humanitarian and development purposes which will contribute to the effective implementation of the project. 
Since the assistances under this project is delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic, all measures and WHO COVID-19 and Health sector guidance will be considered during the implementation. 
CAHPO is currently reviewing internal available resources if we could provide additional support to more vulnerable families. CAHPO will keep informed the clusters and AHF if our internal resources can provide additional assistances. However, using our internal resources, there will be contribution from CAHPO staff at national/provincial levels who have not been allocated under this project.</narrative>
