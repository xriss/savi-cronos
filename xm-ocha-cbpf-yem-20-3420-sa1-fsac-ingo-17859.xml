   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CARE proposes a lifesaving emergency project targeting the most vulnerable acutely food insecure Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in five districts across three governorates Mawiyah, Dimnat Khadir and Maqbanah (Taiz), Tuban (Lahj) and Abs (Hajjah). The project targets a total of 28,700 (men: 6,851, women 6,704, boys: 7,749 and girls: 7,396) IDPs (4,100 HHs) for a period of one year.  Of this number, 7,200 will be targeted under priority 1 of the YHF SA1 in Maqbanah district of Taiz governorate while the remaining 21,500 will be targeted under priority 2 across four districts. In line with FSAC guidelines, CARE will provide   unconditional cash or value vouchers (45, 000 YER or 53,000YER) per family for six consecutive months.  Considering the context and gender gap in Yemen, CARE ensures to tailor the response to the specific needs of the most vulnerable including women and girls as well as context-appropriateness will be ensured to avoid do-no-harm. This project is in line with and contributing to the main objective of the 1st Standard Allocation for 2020 (which is to provide immediate funding to assist people in acute humanitarian needs with a view to mitigate the risks of famine and negative consequences of COVID-19 in Yemen) and the FSAC Cluster objective of &#x2018;increasing access to food for highly vulnerable families across the country&#x2019;


During the inception phase i.e. three months, CARE will seek approvals for the sub agreements and other permits from SCHMCA and MOPIC to allow implementation of the activities. Once the permits are secured, CARE will conduct market assessment and a Baseline study to help establish cash modality and   benchmark for food security indicators whereas an endline survey to assess the relevance, effectiveness and impact of the interventions. Regular monitoring and reporting will be integral part while PDM after two to three weeks of each disbursement will also be conducted to know the utility of the cash and beneficiaries&#x2019; satisfaction level. 


The potential risks that the project may face shall include a significant delay in the signing of sub-agreements by SCMCHA/MoPIC escalation of conflict and access constraints currency fluctuation and lack of adequate liquidity in the financial institutions aid diversion beneficiaries&#x2019; protection/safety risks and spread of COVID 19 to the level where local authorities impose lockdown. To mitigate the above-mentioned risks, CARE will take the following mitigation measures: Working closely and coordinate with OCHA, SCMCHA, and MOPIC for the timely signing of agreements as well as to get timely permit for implementing activities as well as conducting surveys/assessments continuously conduct security assessments in the project areas select and work with financial institutions that have adequate financial capacity and liquidity conduct continuous monitoring during and post distribution of cash and make consultation with community members to identify/select appropriate distribution centers.

CARE has strong technical and operational capacity as well as access in the targeted areas. Led by competent national Area Managers, CARE is well established in the areas and have already discussed the project with relevant stakeholders which ensures their buy-in.</narrative>
