   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mobile site management (MSM) response to vulnerable Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs) at the Kilo 7 informal site in Anbar Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed activities are a continuation of NRC&#x2019;s support to Mobile site management (MSM) activities in Anbar Governorate Kilo-7 (K-7) informal site in Ramadi district delivered to internally displaced persons (IDPs). As many IDPs will be unable to return to their areas of origin due to lack of services, destruction of homes, security clearance issues, and perceived extremist affiliations repeated displacement is expected to rise.


At the same time, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted basic service provision in several areas in Iraq. Municipal services, such as water and electricity, have become increasingly problematic to provide, access of goods and persons to markets and livelihoods has suffered, funding has been reduced or diverted to COVID-specific health and WASH response, and the healthcare system has become overburdened and strained, decreasing access to basic healthcare services. All of the above impacts are exacerbated at formal IDP and refugee camps, and even more so at informal sites, where there is already very limited service provision. The activities proposed in this action address both direct response to COVID-19 through preventative measures and improvements to WASH services, as well as indirect response through more comprehensive service provision and coordination for services.


Recognizing that different groups such as men, women, boys, and girls, people with disabilities, or the elderly have different needs and abilities to access services, NRC will assess and tailor approaches accordingly. Particular attention is given to access issues for women and people with disabilities, for which NRC uses (i) gender-sensitive mobile teams to support linking these groups with relevant services, and (ii) referral system. These interventions are highly important for vulnerable populations who remain displaced in Anbar during 2020 and into 2021. As the focus of both the Government of Iraq (GoI) and institutional donors shifts towards returns and durable solutions for those who are able to return, it is imperative that humanitarian actors maintain support to meet the needs of the under-served population that will remain in protracted displacement.

In this action, NRC will conduct site management and coordination at the Kilo-7 informal displacement site in Anbar. In an effort to improve the living conditions for the vulnerable IDPs, activities will include site risk reduction through maintenance of critical locations and infrastructure, protection by presence, coordination of services, advocacy for services with both local partners and international actors, outreach and community engagement activities, establishment and training of community governance structures with the aim of participating in site coordination, COVID-19 specific prevention and mitigation measures as well as awareness raising through outreach work, and information management via dissemination of assessment and service mapping results, including COVID-19 data.</narrative>
