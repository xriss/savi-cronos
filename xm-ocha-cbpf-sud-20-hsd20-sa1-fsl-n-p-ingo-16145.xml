   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this project is to contribute to saving lives of the most vulnerable people as well as to contribute to the reduction of morbidity associated with malnutrition and preventing livelihood depletion of vulnerable communities through responding to immediate Nutrition, livelihood and protection needs of the target population mainly men and women, boys and girls  in Umm Durein and Leri Localities of South Kordofan State. 
WVI will also work with CARE in the targeted areas for an integrated area-based response to enhance project impacts, promote self-reliance and sustainability. CARE is proposing to provide Health and WASH services in the same geographic areas, targeting the same population under complementary principle.

This project will target 44,637 individuals (15,427 men, 16,712  women, 6,248 boys, and 6,250 girls) in El Liri (35,700) and Umm Durein (8,937) localities, that include 14,989 refugees, 650 IDPS, 8,937 returnees, and 20,061 vulnerable host community members.  According to the latest IPC analysis, the localities targeted by this project are affected by high levels of food and nutrition insecurity (PHASE 3 and 4). A combination of shocks and stresses has affected the targeted communities including conflict and protracted displacement, loss of productive assets, climate change, degradation of natural resources and lack of basic infrastructure and services. More recently, those communities were also affected by the deterioration of the macroeconomic situation, which negatively affected their purchasing power further exacerbating their food and nutrition insecurity.  
The main objective of the project is to assist vulnerable conflict-affected populations in achieving their own food and nutrition security and improve their livelihoods and general wellbeing through integrating FSL, nutrition and Protection interventions. Under food security and livelihoods, this project will provide animal health services including vaccination and voucher-based animal treatment services provided through trained and equipped CAHWs, agricultural support services including provision of seeds and tools packages. Women groups will be formed and supported with training and livelihood start-up kits including goat restocking, support for range land rehabilitation through community participation and cash for work program. Other vulnerable HHs who cannot participate in the labor work will be through unconditional cash transfer and Cash for Work by rehabilitation of community assets such as irrigation canals, water channel, public toilets etc. in addition to community awareness on sustainable and responsible farming, Regarding nutrition intervention, the project will provide CMAM services for SAM and MAM cases of U5 children and PLW (incl. refurbishment of OTP/TSFP/SC, community outreach and MUAC screening, treatment referral service of SAM with complication case etc.), conduct training for nutrition workers, community volunteer on CMAM, IYCF etc. WV will also conduct community awareness campaign on CMAM and IYCF, as well as on mother&#x2019;s role to support community, health and hygiene, CoVID-19 prevention, floods and diseases outbreak preparedness and responses related topics. WV will also establish mother support groups for the promotion of IYCF and include GBV, child protection and reproductive health topics during MSG sessions. WV will construct and operate child, Adolescents women spaces with hand washing facilities, provide protection services for vulnerable people (boys, girls, women, men) that includes psycho-social support, training for protection workers/volunteers, establishment of community based protection network as well as referral mechanism and services mapping. WV will ensure that community awareness sessions focus on protection related issues, as well as CoVID-19 prevention. Protection will be mainstreamed to complement CARE&apos;s WASH and Health activities by adopting their PSEA and safeguarding initiatives as a cross cutting,</narrative>
