   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winterization support for vulnerable people in Kunduz and Nangarhar</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the 6th AHF Reserve Allocation Strategy paper, the revised HRP 2018-2021 SO1, and the 2020-2021 Joint Winterization Strategy strategic objectives, Cordaid proposes to provide winterization assistance during winter in priority 1 areas Kunduz and Nangarhar, following the ESNFI recommended standard modalities for winterization. In the project 3 modolities (Cash, Vouchers and in kind is proposed to increased the effectiveness of the project.
Total 2248 (2023 from AHF and 225 from Cordaid funds) HH will be covered from the project. In Kunduz (Kunduz City, Iman Sahib and Khan Abad) Cordaid will target 1,448 (1225 recently displaced HH who are assessed by Cordaid in October under START Funds and 223 new host) out of 1448 HH 225 2ill covered by Cordaid funding . Each of the HH will receive cash for heating materials @ US$200 through cash in envelop through Boloro   (FSP) in a one off payment, and 3 sheets of blankets in kind. In Nangarhar (Achin, Nazyan, Kot and Batikot) 800 (570 existing beneficiates of ongoing Shelter and 230  food security projects funded by AHF) will be assisted with cash for heating materials @ US$200 through and Modality Vouchers for warm cloths of  US$ 65. In Kunduz the project will be directly implemented by Cordaid while in Nangarhar the project will be implemented by OHW with technical support from Cordaid. 

The project is designed based on recent need assessments in both areas. In Kunduz 98% of the respondents is recently displaced, mentioning conflict as the main reason for their displacement. Because of their displacement people are very vulnerable. 98% of the people also indicated that they had not received any assistance. There is a large percentage of people with specific needs (PSN): 28% of the HH have at least one member with a disability or chronic disease (REACH), and 40% are PLW. In 84% of the Cordaid assessed HH is an ill or chronically ill person, a person who is in need of medical care or, a PWD. According to REACH ESampNFI Winterization evaluation (2019-2020), people&#x2019;s top 3 reported most critically needed NFIs during the last winter period are firewood/charcoal/gas for heating (72%), blankets amp quilts and winter clothes (49%). This is confirmed by Cordaid assessment, almost all respondents mentioned to be in need of winterization assistance. 
In Nangarhar, assessments revealed that half of the responding HH were displaced, with conflict as the main reason for their displacement, further increasing their vulnerabilities and exposure to COVID-19. Nearly 1/5 of the HH reported having at least 1 member with a disability or chronic illness (REACH ESampNFI Winterization evaluation 2019-2020). Because of high coping strategies (82% of the respondents are resorting to negative coping mechanisms) combined with the majority of the people (83%) having a poor food consumption score and 99% having no food stocks at all, people in the assessed districts are severely and acute food insecure. With winter arriving soon, the respondents raised the need for heating materials (69% of the respondents), warm clothes (87%) and blankets (49%). With reduced income, increase in cost of living and limited job opportunities (80% and 67% is unemployed in Kunduz and Nangarhar respectively) people lack the means to protect themselves against winter and are likely to resort to negative coping strategies to keep themselves warm this winter.

The cash will be provided for heating materials because of market functionality. The blanket will be deliver to the beneficiary because of the bulk procurement and will cost us lower the then local markets  . 
Cordaid is leveraging US$ 54,495 from its own funds to the project to reach more people. 
Cordaid is committed to the &#x2018;Grand Bargain&#x2019;: in addition to participation, the use of cash transfers and transparency (ReportHub/IATI) implementation is jointly with OHW.</narrative>
