   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sensitization on the prevention and spread of COVID-19 in Communities of Plateau and Kogi States</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan China around December 2019 has now become a global health emergency ravaging over 150 countries with more than a million people infected with the virus. The number of persons infected keeps increasing daily and fatality rate also increasing on a daily basis with over 77,000 deaths recorded globally. 
Nigeria recorded its first COVID- 19 case on the 27th February, 2020 and within five weeks the number of infected cases have risen to 254 from which there are 204 active cases, 44 recoveries, 6 deaths and over 5000 suspected cases spread across 17 States as at 8th April, 2020. 

Though there have been no confirmed case of COVID-19 thus far in Plateau and Kogi States, but then there is low level of awareness on the preventive measures among masses as social distancing, congregational gatherings, ceremonies/anniversaries, movements, poor hygiene practices are still prevalent across the State. This therefore, if not addressed timely will lead to a wide spread of the virus in the event that a confirmed case is reported. Mamong the people for preparedness and response. This is very key as it will help prevent the occurrence of the ugly situations in many developed countries such as Italy, Spain, America and many others.
It is based on the above background that there is an urgent need to design strategies for sensitization on the preventive measures and good hygiene practices to curb the spread of COVID-19. This could be done through Airing of Jingles, production and distribution of handbills, flyers and provision of handwashing facilities such as buckets, soap, sanitizers to 1000 households and crowded places like motor parks and worship centres.</narrative>
