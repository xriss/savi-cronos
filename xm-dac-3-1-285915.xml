   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The strategic objective is, by various means of advocacy, to reach and influence key decision-makers, and promote the uptake of data-driven recommendations on policies and investments related to gender equality in key international NGOs, UN Agencies and countries, with the aim to accelerate progress towards improving the health and rights of women and girl globally and in developing countries. The objective will be achieved through 1) communication and advocacy materials developed and disseminated in Kenya and globally that contribute to shifting the narrative to prioritize gender equality and girls and women&#x2019;s health and rights, 2) Technical support on gender equality and girls&#x2019; and women&#x2019;s health and rights, including SRHR and the COVID-19 response and recovery, provided to UN agencies and through Women Deliver participation on key task forces and initiatives, and 3) Support to networks of advocates, in order to push for progress on gender equality and girls&#x2019; and women&#x2019;s health and rights, including in the COVID-19 response and recovery, globally and in Kenya.</narrative>
