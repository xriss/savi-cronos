   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The number of new cases in the DRC is continuously increasing, with a test positivity rate of 21% . COVID-19 pandemic outbreak began just as the country was winning a nearly two-year battle with Ebola which had resulted to 3,481 cases and 2,299 deaths. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is growing daily in DRC, and as of February 7th 2021, 23,671 people had been tested to be positive, 15,113 recovered and 681 died. Notably, on November 17th, 2020, the Ministry of Health issued an alert on a new wave of COVID-19 outbreak in DRC, while the Africa CDC warned the government to step up preparation for second wave as 19% increase of cases was noted in DRC as of October . Kinshasa, North Kivu and South Kivu are among the areas greatly affected. As of February, 7th2021, Kinshasa reported 18,575 COVID-19 cases, North Kivu reported 1,366; and South Kivu 607. With limited testing capacity and lack of access to healthcare, the number of actual cases could be far higher, and millions of lives could be lost unless the international community and civil society step up with more help.</narrative>
