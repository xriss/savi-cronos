   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On 30 January 2020, the WHO Director-General declared the COVID-19 outbreak a &#x201C;public health emergency of international concern&#x201D; (PHEIC). The Emergency Committee has also provided recommendations to WHO, to all countries, and to the global community, on measures to control the outbreak. On the 11 March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, affecting 123 countries and territories.  On 5 March, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) reported its first 7 confirmed COVID-19 cases to WHO - a cluster of hotel workers in Bethlehem who were in contact with a Greek tourist group which tested positive for COVID-19 upon their return to Greece. Since then, MoH reported 37 more confirmed cases bringing the total number to 44 (as of 18-Mar-2020, 10:00am). Cases have now been reported in Bethlehem, Tulkarm, Nablus and Ramallah. The MoH has also reported the community transmission of the virus as family members of the first detected had also been tested positive for COVID-19.


Since the first cases were reported globally, the WHO office in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) and partners have been gradually expanding the support to the Palestinian Authority&#x2019;s Ministry of Health (MoH) to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. These efforts intensified since the first reported cases in oPt. The overall objective of this project is to support the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health (PA MoH) to stop the human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 and provide adequate care for patients affected by COVID-19, their families and close contacts. The project aims to accelerate the strengthening and scaling-up of the MoH capacity to prevent, early detect and respond to COVID-19 outbreak. WHO will support the MoH in: (1) procuring and delivering the PPE supplies, (2) supporting MoH&apos;s efforts in scaling-up COVID-19 case management, especially in Gaza focussing on ensuring the ability of the health system to treat COVID-19 cases, including critical ones, and expanding laboratory support. As part of the inter-agency risk communication and community engagement task force, WHO will support collective efforts to educate and actively communicate with the public and reaching the population with tailored messaging through community engagement and interpersonal communication approaches. WHO estimates that up to 5,000 women and men in OpT will have access to adequate COVID-19 treatment, up to 600 patients will have COVID-19 tests and communities in all 5 Gaza governorates will have received communication messages for prevention of COVID-19 (up to 500,000 men and women). Additionally up to 500 health workers will benefit from capacity building activities and up to 65 health facilities will benefit from infection prevention and control supplies.</narrative>
