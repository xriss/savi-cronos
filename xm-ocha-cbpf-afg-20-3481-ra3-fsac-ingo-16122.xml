  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the proposed six-month project, DRC seeks to deliver one-month emergency food assistance to address the immediate food needs of COVID-19 affected IDPs in urban centers of Kandahar. DRC will target 6,642 vulnerable protracted households (HHs) with an average HH size of seven (46,494 individuals) as per the national average using cash as a modality. These HHs are characterized by unstable daily wage labor, and/or other informal or irregular sources of income that have been negatively affected amid government Covid-19 related restrictions, leading to worsened purchasing power and food insecurity. As per FSAC cluster guidelines (Jan 2020), the transfer value for cash for food is $90 USD per HH, representing a full food basket for a HH size of seven individuals. DRC assessment findings (HEAT Jan-Apr 2020) show that 89% beneficiaries indicate food as their first or second preference. This in addition to: COVID-19 mitigating measures such as reduced interaction with beneficiaries, FSPs and shopkeepers the many and scattered street vendors availability and prices of goods and food items and DRC&#x2019;s extensive experience of conflict and culture sensitive cash and voucher programming in the South, deem cash for food to be the safest and flexible modality in target locations. The response is also informed by previous DRC experience and analysis of programming in Kandahar, showing that direct cash transfers as opposed to other modalities and e-transfers will warrant the access and inclusion of women. This will ensure beneficiary dignity and inclusion while supporting the local economy amid COVID-19. DRC has existing framework agreements with financial service providers (FSPs) in target locations ensuring timely and efficient response.


In addition to beneficiary preference for food assistance (HEAT Jan-Apr 2020), and a one-month cash for full food basket, target beneficiaries will be guided on the composition of the recommended food items, nutritional values and availability of the items in the local markets to encourage them to meet the intended food objective. Beneficiaries will be equipped with basic COVID-19 prevention knowledge including discerning rumors from facts, and advise to pace out purchasing of food to reduce market crowds as part of the pre-distribution process through awareness raising and key messaging. 


Based on consultations with the Department of Refugees and Reintegration (DoRR), the FSAC cluster at the provincial levels as well as DRC IDP mapping, and identified response gaps, the selected locations are: Police Districts 5, 7 (Mirwais Mina), 9 (Loya Wala &#x2013; right), 12 (Loya Wala &#x2013; left) and 15 (Haji Arab/Salo Khan Chaman). Together these locations host an estimated 19,500 IDP HHs out of which 6,642 HHs will be assisted. Due to the fluid and fragile situation related to COVID-19, DRC would like to retain the possibility to modify the modality, locations and adjust budget accordingly, should local conditions substantially change as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

DRC will apply a targeted approach to identify vulnerable displaced population HHs in line with FSAC Vulnerability Criteria such as dependency ratio sources of livelihoods and nature of income &#x2013; type, regularity lack of productive assets shelter condition presence of disability or chronic disease etc.). The project will be complemented through AHF-funded protection interventions to ensure vulnerable HHs facing protection concerns and risks (including people with specific needs - PSNs, women/child/elderly headed HHs) are identified during vulnerability assessments, protection monitoring and referred to other services (DRC and other actors). DRC will also consider individuals/HHs referred by other organizations as part of this intervention.</narrative>
