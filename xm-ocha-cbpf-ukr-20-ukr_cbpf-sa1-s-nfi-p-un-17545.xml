   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Response to shelter and protection needs during the winter in Donetsk and Luhansk NGCA</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with its Protection mandate, Multi-Year Multi-Partner Protection and Solutions Strategy for Ukraine, and Country Operations Plan UNHCR addresses the needs of the persons affected by the conflict residing in both Donetsk and Luhansk Non-Government Controlled Areas (NGCA), as well as the needs of those residing along both sides of the line of contact.  With its leading role in Protection and Shelter, UNHCR contributes to the broader humanitarian response within the framework of IASC for the entire crisis-affected population. 
As one of the robust protection tools in its disposal, and as one part of protection case management, UNHCR provides tailored, in-kind assistance to persons with specific needs (Individual Protection Assistance (IPA) to address the most pressing protection concerns. Working together with  partners, at  the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, UNHCR has delivered IPA in-kind assistance to address additional protection needs caused by the pandemic, which has significantly affected the most vulnerable who can no longer cross the line of contact to access  some services including access social benefits. Persons with specific needs are identified using established vulnerability criteria. The assistance is provided in kind instead of cash, due to access restrictions and challenges posed by the lack of functional banking system. 

The armed conflict in Ukraine has caused large-scale destruction of houses, buildings and communal infrastructure. Though many homes have been repaired (either through humanitarian actors or by people themselves), the needs, in both Donetsk and Luhansk NGCA in particular continue to exceed the current level of interventions by humanitarian actors. UNHCR shelter response in NGCA is implemented directly by the respective field offices, following security and protection assessment and mainstreaming protection (including housing, land and property rights) into all shelter activities. With the onset of the cold season, harsh weather conditions will affect, persons whose houses were damaged and persons with specific needs in particular. 


This project proposal includes the following activities: 

1) Provision of Individual Protection Assistance (in-kind) to persons with specific needs residing in both Donetsk and Luhansk NGCA, to address protection needs that are expected to worsen during the winter months and the cold season of 2020-2021 

2) Repair of the private houses and apartments damaged by the armed conflict in both Donetsk and Luhansk NGCA, including light and medium repairs.</narrative>
