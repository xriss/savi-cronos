   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Red Cross Society of Guinea works to contribute to the reduction of Ebola-related morbidity and death. Operations focus on emergency response, recovery of health and care, disaster preparedness and risk reduction, food security and livelihoods, and developing Guinea&#x2019;s Red Cross Society. Since the virus has persisted, operations also include long-term recovery planning to help manage the broader impacts of the outbreak.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2014&apos;s Ebola epidemic in West Africa is the largest to date, and the first ever outbreak in West Africa. The epidemic in the region began in Guinea and then spread to the neighbouring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone. There were also outbreaks in Senegal, Nigeria, and Mali. Guinea is the only country, in West Africa or otherwise, where the virus persists.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the goal of the project is to completely stop the spread of the virus to where there are no new cases, control of the virus is key. Here, health activities, awareness messaging and psychosocial support for communities, especially those that are hotspots for the virus, are provided along with other means of increasing communities&apos; understanding of the virus. Health infrastructures are also improved to be able to more effectively trace and monitor potential outbreaks and increase resilience. Food-for-work assistance is given because the virus restricts movement, having negative economic effects.</narrative>

  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The target for the appeal remains the entire population of Guinea, given that everyone is potentially at risk of contracting Ebola. Interventions will be particularly targeted at women and children, as well as people with disabilities.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project takes place throughout the country, since everyone is potentially at risk for contracting Ebola. However, focus is give to areas where active transmission occurs and areas with highly vulnerable populations.</narrative>
