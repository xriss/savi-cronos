  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SC program interventions are designed to support the most at risk children, youth and adolescents and their caregivers prompted by the sudden camps closure to re-establish the sense of safety and confidence even in the midst of uncertainties brought about by the forced return considering the COVID-19 challenges. This proposal is in response to the camps closure allocation strategy&#x2019; list of priority activities and locations for Child Protection to support comprehensive cases management intervention and in line with the HRP.  
Key activities include:
Gender-sensitive Case Management        
1.SC will adhere to the Case management SoP developed for Iraq and the COVID-19 case management technical guidance developed by the child protection case management-working group for Iraq on the six steps of the case management. SC will ensure all the types of cases included in the case management SOP prioritized and treated equally. Girls will be provided with a gender sensitive case management process and services considering culture and gender related issues. SC will assure identified cases followed up closely and risks are 100% addressed before case closure. 
2.SC will develop a referral pathway for each location considering the already developed referral pathway by the CPWG and mapping for CP services.
3.SC will solicit input from local communities including existing community-based mechanisms/structures, parents teachers, children and youth as well as NGOs partners on ground to ensure at risk children are identified and referred to case management services. SC will use the CM revised criteria of eligibility which part of the revised CM-SoP to determine eligibility for case management and referral to services based on their needs and best interest.
4.SC will train the already existing well-established CPCs in Al Mughdadia and Khaninkhqin through other projects, train the members of those structures on safe identification and referral to identify the critical cases of at risk children and refer those cases to the case management team.
5.The case management teams will exclusively conduct the risk assessment to determine whether the referred cases 
6.are eligible for the case management mechanism following the criteria of eligibility.
7.SC will recruit caseworkers from the affected communities if possible, considering the cultural and gender diversity to better have cases addressed and flowed up by caseworkers from the same community.  
Awareness raising for community-based protection
1.SC will be using the existing community-based (CBCPM) child protection mechanisms building on previous projects in the same locations to implement awareness raising on child protection key areas of concerns, child rights and prevention of child abuse and exploitation. CBCPM will be extended to include representatives of the returnee population. Sessions will be organized with community leaders and community members to consult the..
2.Through the existing and extended community-based groups amp mechanisms SC will mobilize the community to facilitate dialogue between community leaders, tribal leaders, returnees, IDPs and host communities to mitigate risks and support safe returns and social reintegration of the returnees. 
3.SC will support the community mechanisms to develop and design key awareness raising messages and disseminate those messages through awareness raising.
PSS programming
1.SC will provide gender and age sensitive PSS support to the identified at risk children and caregivers based on needs to build psychological resilience, improve beneficiaries&#x2019; social interactions, and address the effects of sudden displacement/forced retunes due to camps closure. This will be through provision of basic counselling one to one sessions for children identified with PSS needs   through SC trained MHPSS staff or referral to specialized service.
