   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EHF WASH Response to Cholera Affected Communities in South Omo, Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Communities in South Omo zone of SNNPR witnessed huge Cholera outbreak and caseloads from early December to April 2020. The spread of the disease was accelerated by poor community access to potable water, poor hygiene practice, low level of sanitation facilities, poor access to NFIs and less improvement on positive behavioral change towards the prevention of cholera. The situation further worsened with the current COVID 19 pandemic challenges. However, humanitarian actors including CA and its implementing partner Action For Development (AFD), a national NGO, made concerted efforts to curb the  cholera widespread, the trend shows rapid increase of cases in the zone and turned to be a new hot spot for the intended intervention. Total of 1,397 cholera cases reported by South Omo Health Department (April 2020). Semen Ari and Salamago woredas exhibited another round of cholera outbreak and still remains hot spot. 
The overall situation in South Omo suggests that more focus has to be given to improve water and hygiene facilities to reduce potential risks of fatalities and contain the spread of cholera outbreak. In view of this, the proposed project plans to increase the coverage of clean water, hand washing facilities, sanitation and hygiene services in the target four woredas of the zone. The four target woredas have been identified based on the high level of risks of new cholera cases as per 2020 HRP and WASH Cluster strategic priorities.

The proposed project aims to undertake the following key activities in Bena Tsemay, Male, Salamago and Semen Ari Woredas. Detail activities include:
1) Rehabilitation of water points - This is aimed to address lack/shortages of  safe drinking water to 18,858 communities in in four woredas. This  will be done by rehabilitating 28 non-functional water schemes and 2 pipe line extensions from existing water schemes with construction of additional water points. 

2) Improving access to hygiene and sanitation facilities - Construction of 12 semi-permanent latrines at public institutions and construction of 26 wash basins around rehabilitated water schemes. Provision of handwashing facilities at health centers, schools, CTCs and other public places. 
3)  Enhancing awareness of communities to control and prevent the cholera outbreak and COVID-19 including provision of IEC material, community and HH awareness sessions through audio vans, posters and HEWs/ community health volunteers 
4)  Provision of water purification and sanitary items - Soap distribution consisting of 250gms of soap for bathing and 200gms for laundry and washing will be provided to 8,800 households as per Minimum Sphere standards. 79,200 strips of chlorine tabs will be distributed to 8,800 households in locations where river/pond water is being used. 
5)  Setting up and support community rehydration centers &#x2013; in collaboration with Woreda health bureau   water storage tankers will be set up in selected locations and chlorine provided for disinfection of water, equipment and materials at CTC and rehydration centers. In addition,  plastic sheets, jerry cans and buckets will be provided for rehydration centers. 
6) COVID 19 response - in order to protect the safety of project staff and the beneficiaries hand washing sites will be established and other disinfectants such as sanitizers will be made available at locations where communities access the services at health centers and CTCs.  Mechanism will be put in place to awareness raising to minimize the risks of COVID 19 at WASH NFI distribution sites during each distribution. At the end of the distribution sites will be disinfected and cleaned to prevent risk of COVID 19.
7) Post distribution monitoring -  will engage beneficiary representatives to making sure that the distribution process meets the intended purpose and suits the guidelines and beneficiary satisfaction.</narrative>
