   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the proposed project is to deliver immediate support to respond to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in A&apos;zaz.The activities will be complementary to an on-going Covid-19 related project in A&apos;zaz under German Federal Foreign Office (GFFO) funding and is based on OPS project HSYR20-FSCSHLWSH.-165380-1.The project intends to integrate livelihood,food security and wash using a cash based modality.In North-West Syria NWS), the price of basic foods remains extremely volatile and is subject to speculation.Disruptive events, specifically displacement and COVID-19 have harmful and immediate consequences on the households&#x2019; economy and may result in reduced consumption and exclusion, requiring the adoption of a framework of priorities and actions that are focused on livelihoods. Proposed intervention has 2components:(1)distribution of cash to internally displaced persons(IDPs) in camps to cover their urgent lifesaving needs 2)Cash for Work(CfW)activities to respond C19 pandemic with a prevention intervention where women are provided with necessary tools/resources to produce fabric masks which will be distributed in schools,camps,facilities.1st component of project aims at covering needs of IDPs in camps in areas of food security and hygiene (multi-sectoral) through cash distribution to support HHs especially in winter as there are less opportunities for livelihood sources due to lack of availability of daily worksamp C19&#x2019;s impact on market. Primary objective of the project is to ensure that displaced families are assisted and provided with means for a dignified life until they have access to durable solutions.Grant will be provided via a money transfer agent following procedures agreed in SoPsincludes C19 measurements.Value of cash transfers will be $90 per HH for 5months,amount of voucher will be same with current WHH project to avoid tension between organizationamptargeted people.As ongoing project already covered for 3months,suggested project will be covering rest of 5months to be compatible with FSL cluster recommendation.There will be verification process for BNFsactivity will take place in Sijjo Okul (125 HHs), Sijjo Shuhada(154 HHs) and Sijjo Sifira(61 HHs)camps(Total number is 340 HHs).The second component is the production of facemasks through CfW.The benefits of wearing facemasks by the public in general in order to reduce the virus spread in communities is clear especially in locations where high-density gatherings cannot easily be prevented due to living conditions, and which are considered as a high risk area for the rapid spread of infection. Due to the lack of availability of medical masks and the necessity of prioritizing them for healthcare workers, reusable fabric facemasks are recommended. The fabric facemask will have three layers: an inner layer made from a 600 thread per inch (600 TPI) white cotton, a middle layer made from a high-thread-per inch (gt80 TPI) blend of 65% cotton and 35% polyester, an outer layer made from a high-thread-per inch (gt80 TPI) colored polyester. 20 women will be selected to produce the face masks, based on willingness to participate in the activity, tailoring skills (knowledge of use of sewing machines). They will receive a training on how to produce/sew fabric masks. Subsequently, WHH will provide each woman with a sewing machine together with the required materials to be used also for the training duration. Women will be producing fabric masks and will package them according to the instructions given during the training. On a weekly basis, they will be asked to produce approximately 3,000 masks which will be collected by WHH field team and distributed in schools, camps and selected facilities. The quality of the masks produced will be checked by the mask production consultant. He/she will provide regular supervision for the production and will report any challenges to the WHH Project Team. Women will be provided 90USD/month for 8 months. 15 PWD will be supported unconditiona</narrative>
