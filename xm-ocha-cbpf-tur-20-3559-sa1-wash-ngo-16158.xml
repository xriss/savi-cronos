   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of sustainable access to clean and safe drinking water for IDPs in Atma camps</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project activities aim to provide life-saving assistance that assures sustainable and safe access of 91,616 IDPs (17,256 Men, 20,464 Women, 28,998 Boys, 24,898 Girls 13742 PwD) living in Atma camps and informal settlements to clean and safe drinking water services through connecting IDP sites to a new installed drinking water system.



Need

------
Currently, drinking water is being supplied to IDPs living in Atma cluster through water tanks distributed withing the camps with limited storage capacity of the HHs living in the camp and informal settlements. The tanks are being filled by water trucking vehicles that transport the water from the nearby boreholes to the tanks. IDPs take their daily share of water from the water manholes next to the tanks and store it in jerrycans or containers. IDPs, especially the most vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly and PwD, face many risks and difficulties while obtaining water. One of the most critical risk is spreading infection with an infectious disease due to crowding at water distribution points, especially with the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to health risks, there are protection risks that are increased with using water trucking method, especially for women, girls, PwD and children. These developments and causes have created an urgent need to upgrade the water system in IDP sites to provide sustainable solutions that ensure the effective and safe access of IDPs to safe and clean drinking water services.

Intervention
---------------
At the beginning of the project, Bonyan Organization will ensure the community engagement through discussion with main stakeholders -including all types of beneficiaries, key informants, and local authorities- to identify locations of water distribution points with considering the initial drawings of the water network. Then Bonyan will develop and sign MoUs with main stakeholders, including 1) Local Authorities, and 2) Humanitarian actors who work in water trucking services in the targeted camps (mainly Global Communities Organization.
Based on results of community engagement discussions, technical assessment, and topographic survey, Bonyan will develop detailed technical specifications and scope of work to identify the number of water distribution points and their distancing in every sub-pipe. The distribution points will feed safe drinking water pipes that will be connected to all tents/buildings in the targeted locations. Bonyan will carry out installation works, using a contractual method under supervision of Bonyan engineering unit, as listed here:
1) Pumping Station
- A ground water tank, capacity of 300 cubic meter
- 4 centrifugal water pumps, power of 15 HP per each
- Electric generator, power of 75 KVA
- Electrical control panel
- Key facilities of the station
2) Water Network
- Water network (HDPE pipes and shutoff valves)
- Connecting the network to existing nearby boreholes.

Besides that, Bonyan will establish 2 hygiene and awareness promotion teams to conduct and design proper awareness promotion activities that ensure physical distancing, COVID-19 related recommendations, and importance of saving water &#x2026; etc.

At the end, Bonyan will hand over the project to the community that is representative by engineering office of Local Authorities in Atma Cluster, and provide it with engineering layouts/ drawings, technical specification documents, and maintenance/ expansion instructions of the pumping station and water network.

Bonyan will achieve the project objective through a series of specific activities and processes, taking into account accountability to affected-people, protection mainstreaming and GBV/PSEA, risk analysis and mitigation, tight monitoring and evaluation processes, and effective coordination with all stakeholders, as well as, a coherent exit strategy that contributes to sustainable results of the project.</narrative>
