   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Burundi Q3 2020 Country Update: 2020 has been marked by a return to a stable trajectory for our program. We are now operating under a five-year Memorandum of Understanding with the Burundian government, and believe our relationship with key ministry stakeholders is the best it has been in several years. We are continuing to implement our strategy of pausing outward expansion while innovating to generate deeper impact and financial efficiency. The program is on track to exceed our revised scale targets for 2020, and moreover, we were able to implement all the major components of our program despite supply chain challenges and adjustments to our model necessitated by COVID-19. Favorable weather helped drive robust harvests, which we project will lead to meeting our impact targets. Lastly, our program achieved 100% repayment for the first season of 2020 (20B; January-June), a strong indicator of financial health and a powerful validation of our value for farmers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are pleased to report that strong farmer demand for our services enabled us to achieve an above-target scale growth to serve 105,000 farm families (encompassing approximately 556,500 beneficiaries, including 283,500 children). This growth has been fueled by strong farmer demand for our services, coupled with the reality that access to high-quality inputs is quite limited in Burundi. To serve this greater number of farmers, our Burundi program also successfully grew to 753 total field staff; the vast majority of these staff are from the communities we serve, and many are farmers themselves.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enrollment for the 2021A season (beginning in September) has been strong, and we expect to serve 112,700 farmers across 17 districts, above our target of 109,000. This relatively conservative expansion is due to our strategy of pausing outward expansion (i.e., opening new districts or sites) due to regulatory and election-related uncertainty, as well as our desire to improve margins and impact before resuming robust growth.  Additionally, we are proceeding with enrollment and input distribution for the 2021A season (September 2020 planting) and expect to serve 112,700 farmers across 17 districts. At present, we continue to exercise a cautious approach to expansion, and are currently focusing on improving our impact as we evaluate the feasibility of external growth in subsequent seasons.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the obligatory removal of our service fees in 2018 by the Burundi government, we have been pursuing operational efficiencies and smart cost-cutting for non-core activities (e.g., R&amp;D) to ensure long-term financial sustainability in the country. We are drawing on our valuable cost-cutting experience in Rwanda, whose smallholder sector closely resembles Burundi&#x2019;s, and where in 2016, this government also prohibited our collection of service fees. In 2017, program streamlining cut 20% from Rwanda&#x2019;s net deficit, helping to generate $4.70 in farmer impact per donor dollar. We believe that our Burundi program is well-positioned to achieve similar outcomes over time.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We achieved 100% loan repayment in 20B, once again demonstrating extraordinary farmer demand for and satisfaction with our Burundi program. To put this result in perspective, we are currently tracking at 91.4% repayment in Kenya, our most mature program. Loan repayment is projected to cover 67% of total program costs in Burundi, slightly below our 2019 results, but in line with the targets of $67 that we set this year. The main factors driving the year-over-year decrease include lower revenues due to narrow margins , higher costs due to unbudgeted COVID-19 spending (including health trainings to clients and soap distribution to clients and their neighbors), and higher transport costs related to fertilizer supply chain challenges.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, we attained an average impact of $34 per farm family - well below our historical impact trajectory in the country. We attribute this shortfall to extensive, consecutive regulatory challenges. For instance, our November 2018 operational suspension (in the 2019A season) limited the products we were able to offer (preventing our distribution of solar lights or trees) and forced a streamlined training schedule that lowered farmer compliance. Similarly, in the 2019B season, many farmers missed the ideal window for planting due to delays among Burundi&#x2019;s authorized fertilizer importers. In spite of these challenges, One Acre Fund remained a strong investment for Burundi&#x2019;s farm families last year, boosting income from supported activities by nearly 27%.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We tentatively project meeting our dollar impact target this year of $60, a substantial accomplishment in the context of Burundi&#x2019;s deep poverty and the host of external challenges listed above. Key factors in our projection include: 1) favorable weather that led to above-average bean harvests from the 20B season; 2) work by our government relations, procurement, and logistics teams to ensure farmers received inputs on time and in the right quantities; 3) adaptation of our training program to ensure delivery of a full suite of field trainings that comply with social distancing protocols (e.g., limiting training group size); and 4) the distribution of impactful agricultural and quality of life products (e.g., trees, solar lights, cookstoves, and cellphones).</narrative>
