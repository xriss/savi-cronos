  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The World Health Organization through the coordination of UNOCHA and all of the sector clusters based out of Gaziantep have put into action the &apos;COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan&#x2019; to ensure that the humanitarian community takes the necessary steps in preparing for any COVID-19 related eventuality. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Response Update Number 6, as of 19 June, 2020, approximately 4 million people including 2.7 million IDP&#x2019;s are in need of humanitarian related assistance. The WHO states that the overall risk of transmission remains high due to a number of risk factors, which include but are not limited to high density in a relatively confined amount of space, close proximity of living quarters with limited access to WASH facilities as well as the health care system&#x2019;s existing limitations due to prolonged effects of conflict. 
Even though the limited number of laboratory tests conducted have not resulted in any COVID-19 positive results in Northwest Syria, this does not negate the fact that Northwest Syria is classified as a &#x2018;High Risk&#x2019; area in terms of the COVID-19 epidemic, as stated by the WHO.
The global COVID-19 outbreak has led to a great imbalance of the supply and demand dynamics of acutely needed COVID-19 response related medical supplies and equipment. These supplies and equipment include Personal Protective Equipment (PPE&#x2019;s) as well as ICU ventilators and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Units (CPAP) devices.
This project aims to support the COVID-19 response related supply chain of the international humanitarian community under the framework of the strategic principles put forward under the Syria COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan. The pandemic threat of this magnitude requires collective solidarity since the virus is threatening the humanity as whole. Thus, in order to minimize the effects of the pandemic, a global response plan is needed to fight with the virus, save lives and help contain the spread of the virus worldwide. 
With the above stated sensitivities in mind, the project will thus procure within Turkey and deliver to WHO / UNOCHA designated warehouses in Northern Syria vital COVID-19 response related medical equipment and materials. These COVID-19 related PPE&#x2019;s are subject to certain legislative limitations in terms of their export from Turkey to third countries. The Turkish Red Crescent will thus get an exceptional permission from the Turkish Ministry of Health as a part of this project in order to facilitate the procured items across the border as a contribution to international humanitarian assistance efforts. These items will be delivered to UNOCHA / WHO designated warehouses in Northern Syria. 
Under this framework the final recipient locations will be two warehouse as stated above, one for those crossing the &#xD6;ncup&#x131;nar / Bab Al Salam (BAS) and one for those crossing the Cilveg&#xF6;z&#xFC; / Bab Al Hawa (BAH) border crossings. The post-delivery distribution phase of the PPE&#x2019;s, ICU Ventilators as well as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Units (CPAP) will be the responsibility of the WHO / UNOCHA partners.  
In case requested by WHO / UNOCHA, the Turkish Red Crescent will also provide warehouse storage assistance for the PPE&#x2019;s, ICU Ventilators as well as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Units in Turkey and transportation services for their final delivery to the designated warehouses in Syria. The timeline for the delivery of the items into Syria will be decided jointly between TRC, WHO and UNOCHA. 
As decided in coordination with UNOCHA and all of the sector clusters, the composition of the Personal Protective Equipment will be as follows: 52.380 units of Apron Disposable, 37.620 units of Face Shields, 8.131.200 units of Nitrile Examination Gloves, 13.629 units of Protective Goggles, units of 159.390 units of Protective Gowns, 8.547.000 units of Medical Masks, 73 units of ICU Ventilators and 15 units of Continous Positive Airway Pressure Unit.</narrative>
