   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winter Relief Assistance to 700 Most Vulnerable IDP, Returnee and Host Community Households in Sarobi district of Kabul Province and Center of Ghazni Province.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to deliver cash and in-kind (multi-cluster) winterization assistance to most vulnerable IDP households affected by recent conflicts and natural disasters (floods) in Sarobi district of Kabul province and in Center of Ghazni province. While it will also deliver 15% of the cash and in-kind food assistance to most vulnerable Returnees and 10% to most vulnerable Host Community Households ensuring a community based approach to properly manage Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) and Accountability to Affected Population (AAP) within the overall implementation process.
UNCONDITIONAL CASH ASSISTANCE: The &#x201C;Cash for Heating Stove and Fuel Assistance&#x201D; in the form of unconditional/unrestricted cash assistance and modality of &#x201C;In-cash payment by FSP&#x201D; will cover 700 households both in Kabul (300 HHs) and Ghazni (400 HHs) provinces. 200 USD per household in Kabul and 260 USD per household in Ghazni will be provided to target households as &#x201C;one time assistance&#x201D; and as per cluster approved packages for Kabul- 3 months and Ghazni- 4 months. For safe, accessible, transparent and accountable transfer of cash to target beneficiaries, we will procure financial services through a register/licensed Financial Service Provider (FSP) in compliance with our finance and procurement policies and guidelines. The request for quotations/services will be widely announced through ACBAR and social media platform, collected quotations will be analyzed against quality and cost effectiveness, a single FSP or two FSPs as deemed necessary will be selected, MoU(s) will be signed with them and will be introduced to project team to ensure they put necessary control measures in place within the overall process. 

IN-KIND FOOD ASSISTANCE: The 4 months food ration will be provided to 350 households both in Kabul (150 HHs) and Ghazni (200 HHs) provinces in 2 distribution cycles- to 50% of the households assisted with Cash to ensure the acute humanitarian needs are met for the persons of concern during upcoming harsh winter season. Our Procurement and Logistic Units will assist the project team in management of goods procurement and logistics align with our internal policies and AHF guidelines to address quality work, transparency and accountability within the process. The FSAC&#x2019;s standard food monthly package includes 46 Kg fortified wheat flour, 4.5 Kg Vegetable Oil, 8.4 Kg pulses and 1 Kg iodized salt.    
As an active member of wide coordination network in Central and South East Regions (HRTs, OCTs, PDCs, PDMCs, PSN Network, Social Protection and clusters), as CBPM partner of UNHCR and emergency partner of WFP- we are closely working with UNHCR, OCHA, UNICEF, IOM, DRC, IRC, DACAAR, IR, IRW, SCI, SCA, CARE International and other national/international NGOs in the network as well as with government line departments and local administration to ensure our assistance reach to our beneficiaries in an safe, accessible, transparent and participatory manner and we also avoid any duplication in our response(s). The distribution points will be selected in coordination with government line departments, local administration and target communities ensuring that no potential barriers exist to restrict the beneficiaries from accessing the assistance in a safe and participatory manner. We will use cluster&#x2019;s recommended tools for market assessments, multi-sectorial need assessments/beneficiary selection and Post Distribution Monitoring (PDMs) for both of the components (unconditional cash amp in-kind food) ensuring that the most vulnerable get both of the packages and others only receive unconditional cash assistance as planned. The PDMs should reveal that how the unconditional cash amp in-kind food assistance assisted the target population of concern to overcome the challenges during the harsh winter in respect to the project indicators. In coordination with DoPHs to coordinate and respect all COVID-19 protection measures within the overall process</narrative>
