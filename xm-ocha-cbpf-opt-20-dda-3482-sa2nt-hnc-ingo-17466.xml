   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustaining Essential Eye Care Services During Health Crisis (COVID-19)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Eye care provision to the Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank has been hugely affected by the full lockdown and the following strict restriction of movement by Palestine and Israel ophthalmic patients have been unable to access any of the eye care services nationally for more than six months, which have led to huge suffering of patients who could lose their sight being unable to access treatment services. The Ministry of Health has been unable to provide eye care for its own patients since the outbreak of COVID-19 and is now fully reliant on St. John, as its main referral center for MoH, to tackle the urgent unmet needs of its vulnerable patients.
St. John Eye Hospital Group, despite being the single largest provider of eye care services to the Palestinian, has also experienced a dramatic drop in the number of patients at its 4 facilities in East Jerusalem (main hospital), West Bank and Gaza. The first lockdown had resulted in more than 18,000 patients missing their scheduled medical appointments for examination and clinical treatment much worse, over 1,200 major sight&#x2010;saving surgeries were cancelled. These numbers are only representing SJEHG, and it is expected to be much higher on a national level. Many of those patients are under risk of losing their sight, either partially or fully.

The proposed one-year emergency project aims at ensuring availability and accessibility to the most essential quality eye care services by operating essential Cataract surgeries for patients who are under high risk of avoidable blindness if timely interventions did not take place.
Accordingly, St. John and the Ministry of Health have agreed a national emergency eye care plan, governed by a partnership memorandum of understanding, to respond to the urgent need for essential eye care services in time of health crisis (COVID-19) to vulnerable patients who have no other option for treatment. Many patients are currently unnecessarily blind or visually impaired because of treatable conditions and diseases. The Framework agreement initially targets MoH patients and non-MoH patients (i.e UNRWA) to receive the much needed services and therefore 70% of the cases will be selected by the Ministry of Health based on a certain criteria, and 30% will be UNRWA refugees, to whom St. John is the only resort for treatment.

The project will mainly target the most vulnerable population groups in the West Bank and East Jerusalem (as described in later sections) through our national partners Ministry of Health and UNRWA. Medically, patients with severe visual impairment caused by Cataract and Diabetic Retinopathy, both being the leading causes of avoidable blindness in Palestine, will be targeted as agreed upon with the Ministry of Health</narrative>
