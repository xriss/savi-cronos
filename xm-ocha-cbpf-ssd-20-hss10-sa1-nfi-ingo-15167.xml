   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall, the security situation in South Sudan has remained largely stable throughout 2019 and the formation of the new unity government has progressed peacefully since February 22, 2020. However, while ICV (Intercommunal Violence) have remained part of a relatively consistent pattern linked with increased mobility during dry seasons, incursions of rival clans/minorities and cattle raiding, humanitarian actors are experiencing increasingly difficult access conditions and localized spikes in crime and ICV since the first quarter of 2020. In the absence of key government figures and functional administration at state level,these trends are expected to continue until government formation process has filtered down to state and district levels.


The formation process has also proved conducive to returns of both internally/externally displaced HHs to parts of Unity and South Sudan at large, as well as increased mobility of HHs already residing in Bentiu POC and now looking to return to or settle in other parts of Unity.  In order to understand the trend of the movement of population in Beyond Bentiu Response, Concern will continue to monitor movement patterns around Bentiu POC, and the security situation in all targeted areas through its network of partners including OCHA, clusters, INGOs, NNGOs, as well as local authorities and community leaders. 
Under this grant, Concern&#x2019;s team in Unity aims to implement a mobile SNFI response in Rubkona,  in Beyond Bentiu Response location with high concentrations of returnees and IDPs that have relocated and resettled to Bentiu town. Through this flexible and mobile response Concern aims to ensure adaptability and ability to operate in the increasingly complex and unpredictable context, with capacity to respond within 1 week of an alert of sudden onset displacement in Beyond Bentiu Response, returnee arrivals and/or both secondary and tertiary displacement,  Mobile responses will provide access to SNFI assistance through targeted distributions of SNFI materials directly from the pipeline, with the composition of shelter materials and NFI kits (in line with existing guidelines) to be based on assessments with communities, so that assistance is appropriate to the specific needs of women, men, girls and boys and PSNs.

Due to the congestion in Bentiu PoC, IDPs have continued to resettle in Bentiu and Rubkona towns, and the towns are now also seeing a significant amount of returnees seeking a base to mobilize resources from in preparation for returns to more remote locations. With Bentiu and Rubkona towns having seen significant destruction and displacement during the conflict, options for rehousing opportunities and temporary shelter solutions remain limited, and as a result, S/NFI needs continue to remain high with market availability of even basic materials having been limited significantly by the flooding of critical access ways in mid- and late 2019. 
Concern will identify and train fabricators to produce mats for roofing, and beneficiaries will use vouchers to purchase these at fairs. For shelter materials and NFIs that cannot be provided at fairs or in case of further limitations on movements/gatherings imposed by the government in response to COVID-19, items will be sourced through the pipeline. CWW will also maintain its role as State SNFI Cluster focal point in Unity and continue to maintain ability to rapidly respond to urgent S/NFI needs in Unity at request of CCCM/local authorities. 

The cost of per beneficiary for the in-kind modality is estimated at 15USD for the items coming from the pipeline while for the cash modality, every household will be entitled to voucher worth 25 USD for lifesaving NFIs and 45 USD voucher for emergency shelter which they will use to exchange for the items with traders in the local market. Overall this project will target 20,000  beneficiaries (12,000 through Cash and Voucher and 8,000 through in-kind) at a cost of 15USD per beneficiary.</narrative>
