  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Space of Peace (SOP) through this project aims at mitigating protection risks and responding to the critical protection needs in Ariha district, by providing life-saving and specialized Gender-Based Violence (GBV) services in Women and Girls Safe Space (WGSS) and child protection services in Child Safe Space (CFS). Through outreach teams in Ariha taking into consideration all the technical guidance notes of COVID 19, where the population of this area at high risk after their hard displacement experience recently. By the time they were able to return, COVID-19 pandemic emerged globally posing additional concern to them. This encouraged people to return to their demolished houses instead of facing the risk of infection in the camps.
SOP has a presence in Ariha through protection projects in the area for 4 years ago and managed to build trust with the community. The center became known to all the different age and gender groups in the community. Our past protection interventions had a positive impact on the community in general and especially on women, girls, boys including PWD. The exacerbated needs and the staggering protections risk in this district have been identified through rapid assessments and stressed by the local council in Ariha that welcomed our return to the area to provide our usual services. 
Through this project, SOP will work to achieve the following outcomes, through operating static centers and mobile teams:
1) The safety, dignity, and well-being of vulnerable women and girls are improved.
2) Address the specific protection needs of children who are survivors or at risk of violence, abuse, and exploitation through providing quality-specialized child protection services.
3)The resilience of the local community is enhanced by providing lifesaving emergency protection services and protection monitoring.
SOP will target in Ariha district 5 communities(Ariha, Motaram, Nahaleh, OrmEljoz, and Nahliya with a total population of 86843 people (17921 men, 20913 women, 28919 boys, 19090 girls). SOP will target 2737 women, 2865 girls, 1975 boys, and 713 men of returnees&#x2019; host communities and IDPs through this project with specialized and none specialized protection services three parts (GBV, CP, PM).
GBV activities: The activities will be provided along with a full package of other services mitigating GBV risks through like awareness-raising sessions including GBV, SEA risks, group and individual PSS sessions, case management, referral services to survivors of GBV and empowering women, girls through life skills and vocational training. Mobile teams will be covering Ariha communities and will be reaching out to cover the proposed areas. We will also provide responses to GBV risks through case management and referral to other services.
All these activities will implement according to GBV SC guidance note on GBV service provision in the time of COVID-19 and IASC Interim Guidance on COVID-19 &#x2013; Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.
