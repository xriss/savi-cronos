   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to EPI Balochistan in response to COVID-19 to resume Routine Immunization</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since COVID-19 appeared in Pakistan, Federal and Balochistan Government has responded with involvement of Health Deptt. All primary amp essential healthcare services were suspended including Routine Immunization (RI). Fully immunized coverage of Baluchistan is 29% which is the lowest in country. The other alarming figure is 24% Children with zero dose of any antigen. The performance of immunization program has improved with more focus from government/partner organization(s) but still a lot of efforts are required to achieve global/regional goals. Knowing that Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) cause around 24% of the mortality among children under five, continuation of RI services is imperative to avert the thousands of deaths.


The health system is already burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic and in order to counter future outbreak of any disease it was considered important that the routine immunization be resumed so that efforts made from decades may not be futile. Through this intervention, TF strives to strengthen EPI Program Balochistan in ensuring personal protection of EPI frontline workers, build trust of parents of children that vaccination staff is well prepared to prevent exposure of children during immunization process. The proposed project will supplement resumption of RI activities with safety of 1422 staff in 03 high risk districts i.e. Quetta, Pishin amp Killa Abdullah is ensured for at least 04 months period through provision of  Personal Protective Equipment (Masks, Gloves, Sanitizers, Disposable Gowns) to EPI Balochistan frontline workforce particularly Vaccinators, Lady Health Workers and Monitors. This will support the resumption of smooth routine immunization service with precautionary measures at frontline workers&#x2019; end, static EPI centers with hand washing protection and disinfection. The project will target the high-risk districts of Balochistan in both contexts&#x2019; vaccination under EPI and the Covid-19 with highest number of cases in targeted districts.  TF will also produce the advocacy material on COVID-19 precautions as well as social distancing protocols at district/community level as an integration to EPI activities. On the other hand, TF will develop IEC material regarding EPI in COVID-19 pandemic situation and importance of both the routine immunization and precautionary measures including social-distancing would be shared through a dedicated campaigning on social media (targeted advertisement) and at the static vaccination points with the information material (non-transferable) while important places at each district will be covered with IEC material placed in shape of banners/posters. All the 126 static centers will also be provided with the hand washing units with availability of soaps/water. The 126 facilities will also be provided with disinfectant liquid for the static facility disinfection with sprayer tools supporting routine disinfectant activities. 


The project will also focus on capacity building of the EPI frontline workers (Vaccinators, LHWs amp Monitors) focusing IPC protocols and guideline developed by federal EPI with technical support of WHO. Training of Trainers (ToT) will be conducted involving existing trainers from EPI/MNCH programs amp consultants. These MTs will be responsible to undertake trainings at the field in 03 districts to orient the front-line workforce on IPC in context of COVID-19 to resume the RI with precautionary measures and stop the spread of not only COVID-19 but other infections too. 

The overall support under the proposed project will be to operationalize the essential service of RI activities in 03 high risk districts through by EPI Balochistan for at least 04 months with minimum safeguarding against the COVID-19 spread with the approach of providing PPE to Frontline workers, capacity building on Infection prevention and control, hand washing and disinfection of EPI static centers, advocacy at district level through Social Media amp IEC Material.</narrative>
