   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH Assistance for vulnerable host and out-of-camp South Sudanese Refugees in El Jabalian locality, White Nile State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to provide basic lifesaving Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services and facilities to at least 25,000 people (about 5,000 HHs) in 8 villages (Alagaya, Alganaa, Almagabi, Alaoudha, Almusalameia Kaja, Kilikees, Shandi Foog, Um Alguara - Kanbo 4)  in El Jabalian locality, White Nile State. Affected population to be targeted by the project will be vulnerable host communities (HCs) and out of camp South Sudanese refugees (SSRs). The project will also target schools and health facilities (provision of sanitation and hygiene facilities).
Key considerations will be made to ensure specific safety, privacy and security needs of women, girls, men, boys and people with special needs are addressed during delivery of project activities.

Project activities will specifically seek to provide and enable vulnerable out-of-camp SSRs and  HCs access water, sanitation and hygiene services and facilities through rehabilitation/upgrading of water pipeline systems and Hafir (repair and maintenance of pipe lines, water distribution points, elevated Oxfam tanks, plate forms, and drainage systems) construction of latrines in schools, health facilities and community/social centres to discourage open defecation conducting of hygiene awareness/cleaning campaigns and establishment/strengthening of community-based WASH structures such as Water Users Committees, Hygiene Committees and Hygiene Clubs in schools through trainings and provision of tools. The project will incorporate messages on prevention and control of COVID-19 and cholera/AWD (as a proactive move to equip target population with information in view of the on-coming rains starting from July/August) in the hygiene awareness/cleaning campaigns.


The project will be implemented for a period of ten months.
Expected project impact is improved personal, household and environmental water, sanitation and hygiene status of the vulnerable out-of-camp SSRs and HCs in the eight target villages in El Jabalian locality.
Hygiene promotion campaigns will be conducted in close collaboration with health and nutrition partners.
Implementation of project activities will mainstream gender and persons with special needs&#x2019; priorities and participation. For instance, in repair and maintenance of water pipeline systems/sources, construction of latrines, conducting of hygiene promotion activities, women, girls, boys, men, and people with special needs will be consulted on processes of planning, implementation and monitoring of project activities to ensure their specific needs and preferences on safety, security, and privacy are considered. Trainings to be conducted in the project will provide specific inputs and will be devised to enhance women, girls, men, boy and people with special needs&apos; capacities, while ensuring all groups are adequately represented in the groups of trainees. All community trainings will be planned with greater considerations of the COVID-19 prevention requirements outlined by the Ministry of Health on social distancing. All data will be age and gender segregated.
Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD) has a well-established office in Kosti with sufficient qualified staff and facilities. Having implemented several projects is El Salam, El Jabalian, El Douiem, Kosti, and Rabak localities on WASH ( and in other sectors namely FSL, Protection, NFIs through emergency response and Education), CAFOD has strong understanding of community needs, and has developed deep community relations and connections in efforts to address those needs. In this project, CAFOD will partner with Sub-Sahara International Development Organization (SIDO), a national NGO which has an office in Kosti and implementing projects in the proposed project locality. Project activities will be implemented by SIDO, with CAFOD Khartoum and Kosti offices providing project management and technical support.</narrative>
