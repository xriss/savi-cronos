   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is focused on the state of human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic. RWI will undertake a systematic analysis of human rights implications of COVID-19 response and recovery measures in 15 developing countries. The main outputs of the project will be: a refined tool that facilitates constructive engagement with states on the human rights implications of legal and policy measures adopted in response to COVID-19, 15 national law and policy reports addressing the human rights-implications of COVID-19 response in the selected developing countries, a comparative analysis of good practices and issues of concern, and a global webinar. The project will lay the foundation for a more ambitious global initiative, which will provide agenda-setting for the post-pandemic world, as well as capacity building for national researchers and other actors, and a wider analysis of policy responses to the pandemic worldwide.</narrative>
