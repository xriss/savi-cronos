   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Description of the crisis (including number of affected, timeline, number of affected Oxfam has reached to date etc):
COVID-19 (Coronavirus acute respiratory disease) was first identified in late 2019 in Wuhan in Hubei province, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing pandemic. While there are so far only seven laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Somalia (first case: 16 March 2020), it must be noted there are no testing facilities and tests are currently sent to South Africa. Results are received after two weeks. The country has only 15 intensive care unit beds and ranks 194th out of 195 in the Global Health Security Index. Over a third of Somalis do not have enough clean, safe water to meet their daily needs, let alone for more frequent preventive handwashing. It goes without saying that an outbreak of COVID-19 in Somalia would have a devastating impact on vulnerable communities who already suffer from drought, conflict and most recently, locust invasion. 6.3 million Somalis are food insecure, 2.1 million internally displaced. The below activities would provide Oxfam Somalia and our partners with a top-up to the 50,000 GBP recently received through the CAT Fund.
Project description / activities (including numbers to be reached):An additional 100,000 GBP (50% as loan, 50% as grant) will enable Oxfam and our partners to scale up the WASH preparedness activities as well as support partner Shaqodoon on extending the COVID-19 helpline to Somalia#s Puntland State. Shaqodoon are currently in the process of completing the set-up of the helpline in Somaliland (with support from the current CAT Fund grant); to be launched by 11th April. The helpline in Puntland willfollow the same process as in Somaliland: Shaqodoon will develop the system and link it to a toll-free Coronavirus hotline providedby Puntland#s Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health will work closely with WHO and identify health personnel who will be trained in receiving and processing calls. Shaqodoon will provide pre-recorded health messages, on-site technical support and data analysis/dashboards for the Ministry.The remaining amount will be utilised to scale up COVID-19 preparedness activities in Somaliland and Puntland, in collaboration with partners. Itwill also be used to top-up partners# crisis modifiers from other donors to make theircontribution in this fight, more meaningful. Activities include set-up of handwashing points in settlements, purchase and distribution of hygiene kits to IDP communities, dispatching mobile teams to disinfect busy public areas and purchase of HTH chlorine pumps for disinfection.50,000 people will be reached by Oxfam#s and partners# WASH COVID-19 preparedness activities.Shaqodoon through the Ministry of Health of Puntland hopes to reach a majority of Puntland#s phone users with COVID-19 information sharing and prevention messaging.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>
