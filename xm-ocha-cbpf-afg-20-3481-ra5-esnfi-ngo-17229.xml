   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2020 update to the 2018 - 2021 HRP seeks US$ 1.1 billion to reach 11.1 million people with emergency life-saving humanitarian and protection assistance across the country in 2020. The HRP&#x2019;s strategic objectives, which are intended to span the entire life-cycle of the response, focus on the lives saved in the areas of highest needs. The 5th Reserved Allocation with a maximum total amount of US$ 15 million for life-saving humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. The ES/ NFI cluster covers a total of 160,755 vulnerable individuals from the IDPs, returnees, and host communities with a total available fund of US$ 5 M to provide life-saving assistance for winterization through a winter response package of relief.


Vulnerability levels are expected to increase due to harsh winter conditions, with temperatures dropping as low as -12.1 degrees centigrade. A total of 1.3 million people will not have access to heating/fuel and other seasonal items needed to cope during the winter, people are in dire need of winterization package of (Fuel and heaters, Blankets package, and winter clothing kit) as they don&#x2019;t have enough money to afford to purchase winterization packages to keep them warm.
ORD will ensure that the most vulnerable people in need among the affected population group prioritized for the winterization response cash for fuel and heaters and in-kind blanket packages and winter clothing kit interventions to a single-family to holistically response their winterization needs. Moreover, the family doesn&apos;t qualify for all three packages it will receive only the needed package. ORD will use the specific vulnerability criteria for identifying the extremely vulnerable among the affected population that include female-headed household child-headed household disabled headed household elderly headed household very large family (8 members or more) very poor families families with chronically-ill members or having other pressing vulnerability. These criteria are adopted by the ES/NFI cluster and to a large extent are in line with vulnerabilities endorsed by other clusters in Afghanistan. 

ORD intends to provide winterization assistance in Paktika province which is in the priority 1 province. To reach the most vulnerable families, ORD has designed the lifesaving proposed project, which will be implemented in Paktika province (Zarghoon Shaher, Khair Kot, Jani Khil districts). ORD has a strong presence since 2018, and currently delivers the below responses under the partnership of the UN-WFP, UN-FAO, CAI, and REACH assessment for all clusters. The current 5th Reserved Allocation fund will scale up and fill the gap of ORD&apos;s current response and will be holistic and become a multi-cluster response to the vulnerable population. The current response of COVID-19, Food Security, and Education that ORD is delivering to the communities by adding the winterization package, the response will be a holistic and multi-cluster response to fill the existing gap.

ORD  conducted a market assessment survey in Paktika province and recommended delivering this response in two kinds cash for fuel and heaters and in-kind for blanket packages and winter clothing kits due to the lack of quality blanket packages and winter clothing kits availability in the local market. Cash for fuel and heaters will be distributed to the ROSHAN M.paisa system which will be responsible for delivering cash to selected beneficiaries. 860 of families selected will be receiving 260$ cash for the heating equivalent in AFN as per the exchange rate during distribution in one-off installment the transfer amount will be based on the distribution plan and determined before distribution,  while 860  families will receive warm winter clothing and 860 families will receive blankets in kind, in accordance to ESampNFI cluster standards.PDM will be conducted by the ORD MEAL department and the report will be shared with clusters.</narrative>
