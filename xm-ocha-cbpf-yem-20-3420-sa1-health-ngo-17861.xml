   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project HUMAN ACCESS will continue to take part in an integrated response along with other humanitarian actors to share in famine risk reduction by responding to the critical health needs in IPC prioritized districts . The overall objective of this project is to contribute in improvement of the health situation and life-saving interventions through providing quality minimum service package to the most vulnerable population in 3 IPC districts in Taiz and Lahj.
The project strategy is in line with the IFRR approach which developed by the 4 related clusters. The project response has 2 different levels : institutional amp community levels.


The project will provide Minimum Service Package (MSP) including Primary Health Care (PHC) and Reproductive Health (RH/FP) services in the targeted communities within the targeted districts through supporting fixed health facilities HFs with skilled health providers. In the service delivery side , the project will operate 4 HFs and one outreach team to provide MSP services in 2 districts in Taiz and one district in Lahj:


Lahj : 
1- Ras Al Arah hospital (Al Madariba Wa Al Ara).
2- Al Saqya HU (Al Madariba Wa Al Ara).

Taizz:
1- Al Wahda HC (Al Qahirah).
2- 14th October HC (Al Qahirah).


The outreach team will cover areas of IDPs and HCs in Salh district in Taizz since there is no HFs there , and this areas will be coordinated and approved by GHO during the preparation period of the 1st month of the project.
In parallel with the HFs services , we will receive RH kits from UNFPA to be distributed under RHIAWG supervision. 

In the community side the project will conduct activities to increase awareness and facilitate the project activities among the targeted communities. The community awareness approach will consider the mitigation of COVID-19 amp cholera and will include the main health massages related. 

At institutional level, HUMAN ACCESS is going to support the capacities of the (4) public health facilities and one outreach team (selection approved by GHOs/DHOs in Taizz and Lahj for fixed HFs - and the list will be verified by Human access- whereas the staff of outreach team will be selected through competitive process and will be hired by HUMAN ACCESS ) to provide MSP health services to selected communities. The medical supplies will be procured through INTERSOS.

The training of HCWs  and CHVs will be done at the preparation period .

The project will provide hazards allowances for (40) health Facilities staff (male amp female) in the targeted HFs for ten months.

Comprehensive approach will be adopted to promote good hygiene practices. HUMAN ACCESS is going to select (30) CHVs (50% female) from the targeted districts. Three 3-days training workshops about comprehensive hygiene promotion approach will be hold for the selected CHVs, staff of the supported health facilities and outreach team&#x2019;. Raising awareness activities for men, women, boys, and girls, and counselling sessions in fixed health facilities will be done through ten months in the targeted districts. With participation at the core, promotion activities and distributed IEC materials will emphasize health key massages and prevention of diarrhea, hand washing, menstrual hygiene, infant and young child feeding, water treatment, food storage, waste disposal, as well as COVID-19 and cholera key awareness messages. Men and women of all ages will be encouraged to participate so they can voice their concerns and express their preferences while implementing the project activities.
