   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Life-saving and integrated Education, Child Protection and Gender Based Violence Services to Conflict-affected Children  Youth in Ayod County, Jonglei State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INTERSOS and Christian Mission for Development (CMD) are proposing this 9-month integrated Education in Emergency (EiE) and Protection (CP and GBV) intervention, in order to address critical gaps in service provision in Ayod County. The project will target the needs of the affected population and based on the experience and presence of both partners in the area. INTERSOS and CMD will work closely with the existing structures and stakeholders, abiding to South Sudan guidelines and protocols, and empowering the community and local capacities. Focusing on needs of children, the partners will target Wau and Pajiek Payams. 
The core of the CP activities will be conducted in 2 community-based Child Friendly Spaces (CFS),whilst EiE ones in 12 CMD supported primary schools and 2 ECD centres where 7,367 children aged 3 to 17 (2,843 girls) will attend EiE and Psychosocial Support (PSS) activities. 

INTERSOS and CMD will implement an education model in Ayod, aimed at sustaining continued learning, while adhering to COVID 19 infection control and prevention protocols. This will include a neighborhood schooling model through which teachers staying within the vicinity of neighborhood homes will reach out to a cluster of children. Volunteer teachers will also be involved in IEC materials distribution as well as COVID19 awareness.
One of the focus of the project will lie in stabilizing regular attendance of children in 2 Early Child Development (ECD) and 12 primary schools in the target area. This goal will be accomplished by providing inclusive and protective education services, refurbishing of Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS), as scale up of the existing facilities, and WASH facilities, teaching and learning supplies and trainings in order to increase teacher&#x2019;s pedagogic skill and PSS care. Moreover, the project will target Parents and Teachers Associations (PTA) and School Management Committees (SMC) as well as local education officials providing them with trainings on addressing CP/GBV issues in schools and enhancing local education leadership.

The project will also focus on establishing and strengthening the community-based protection networks (CBPN) and youth clubs to prevent and respond to child protection risks, while conducting workshops on children&apos;s wellbeing, needs in different development stages, risks and threats in the community, positive parenting skills through active listening, conflict resolution and prevention of family separation. 
Awareness events for in and out of school children in the CFS door to door sessions, and campaigns and public drama sessions on back to school, girl-child education, child protection issues including Other Vulnerable Children (OVC). Workshop with non-CP actors on child protection and referral pathways to ensure a well-coordinated CP and GBV response that is both age- and sex-sensitive. 
All the activities will follow SOPs and regulations developed in the framework of the Covid-19 response, adapting the methodology of implementation. Moreover, awareness sessions will also focus on the disease spreading, on its prevention and mitigation measures, as well as on the possible impact on people with special needs, including children and women. 
The overall target of the project will be INTERSOS and CMD work closely with line departments and local authorities in the project area. The long-term presence of the organizations, their cooperation and collaboration with local key stakeholders and involvement of community members in their programming led to trust and positive working relationships. INTERSOS and CMD Country Office representatives as well as field-based Project manager and Field Coordinators hold regularly programmatic and administrative meetings with governmental bodies represented by the concerned ministries. 
INTERSOS will target 15,367 (6,843 F) vulnerable children, including 400 children with disabilities, belonging to IDP, returnee and host communities.</narrative>
