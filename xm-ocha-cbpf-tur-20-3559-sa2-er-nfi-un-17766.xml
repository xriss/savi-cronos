   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated emergency livelihood and SNFI support to vulnerable populations affected by COVID-19 and harsh winter conditions in NWS</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the increasing rise of COVID-19 cases in Northwest Syria and the upcoming harsh winter season as well as persistent violence and a weak economic system, vulnerable people in Dana, Idleb and Atareb subdistricts face significant livelihood challenges and the inability to access critical shelter and non-food items. IDP, host community and returnee populations chronically lack the ability to access livelihood opportunities and the existing manufacturing industries remained strained as a result of the compounding factors. Meanwhile, portions of the population in Dana and Atareb do not have the capacity to work also do not have access to critical household items for the upcoming winter season. This integrated project aims to strengthen the livelihoods of vulnerable people in these sub-districts to produce fabric reusable masks while also supporting people who do not have the ability to work but require urgent SNFI goods for the upcoming winter season. 

With the chronic lack of livelihoods and potential impact of COVID-19 as described above, the project aims to: First, scale-up emergency livelihood support focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on the already precarious, pre-existing socio-economic deficits in NWS by providing vocational training and Cash for Work opportunities to 900 individuals in reusable fabric mask production in Dana, Idleb and Atareb subdistricts, and Second, provide business support to 50 new businesses, inactive existing sewing business and women&#x2019;s groups through business/capital grants and workforce support for mask manufacturers to protect livelihood sources in Dana, Idleb and Atareb subdistricts. As a third and complementary aim in relation to emergency SNFI support, the project will target 2600 households in Atareb and Dana subdistricts that do not have the capacity to work and provide them with cash for winter to purchase SNFI materials to mitigate the impact of the harsh winter season. 

This action aims to not only strengthen livelihood opportunities and the local economy but also to produce and distribute 635,000  fabric reusable masks to 158,750  individuals who do not have access to masks. The full suite of activities aims to meet both the acute and long-term needs of the vulnerable communities by providing short-term work opportunities, strengthening businesses, providing cash for winter to purchase SNFI winterization materials to 2600 vulnerable households not capable of working, and distributing critical COVID-19 mitigation materials and sensitization messaging to 158,750 people. 

UNDP is the global lead agency in the area of Early Recovery and Livelihoods Restoration with extensive experience in ERL projects, including inside NWS. UNDP will work in partnership with IYD, a national NGO which has experience in both ERL and SNFI projects. On the whole, UNDP will be responsible for overall management of the project and its oversight against programmatic and fiduciary risks through efficient contractual arrangements and administrative support. This will ensure timely implementation of the project, the high quality of activities and the program deliverables. Moreover, UNDP&#x2019;s early recovery and livelihoods team will provide technical guidance and expertise to ensure the quality and appropriateness of livelihood activities, the sustainability of the business support which will improve the effectiveness of the project and better outcomes for beneficiaries. The added value of IYD is anchored to their experience in both ERL and emergency SNFI activities in Idleb and Aleppo governorates, including previous livelihood support and winterization SNFI projects. The complementary partnership between UNDP and IYD will ensure the success of the project and that the needs of beneficiaries are addressed.</narrative>
