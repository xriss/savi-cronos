   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. HISTORY:
          Community Action for Transformation or CAFOT is started in August of 2017 desired to engage the refugees youth in particular and the host community in comprehensive peace building, Hygiene and sanitation promotion and advocating for a quality education as a mean of building resilience and health living among the south Sudanese and host communities. The organization was started by a group of young people with the vision; to create a safe and peaceful atmosphere for human race including his God-given plan, domestic and wild- life and to deliver socio-economic development. So far the organization has improved since its formation andit also has taken gender mainstreaming as co in achieving its vision through programming, planning, andimplementation.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS:       So far there is a resilient building among the refugee and the host community through the public forums that CAFOT already carried on since the beginning of 2018.There is trust building among the young people, youth are already getting into groups to start up small business as a means to fight poverty and building a stronger relationshipThrough our established school, the children are progressively moving in a right direction to face the future, this is meantto ensure illiteracy in removed completely in our society.3.    INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSE:Mission:  To see a reduced rate of the prevailing trauma, conflict and to build a health livingamong the refugees and host communities by provision of education, creation of awareness on hygiene and sanitation through participatory drama (forum theatre) and music.  a. Institutional objectives:1. To Open Adult literacy classes, Nursery and lower primary classes2. To empower the rural women by providing trainingson basic business entrepreneurship skills, and creation of income generating activities3. To create a flat form for communities to interact on societal issues that affect their living and adopt on the dynamics of the modern change as relates to positive resilience in community development.4. To promote Hygiene and sanitation, as wellas unity, equality with gender sensitivity, justice and everlasting peace in the community through advocacy and other measures where necessary5. To create awareness oncorruption, gender-based violence, promote leadership and good governance6. To promote social understanding among, youth, women, elderly, children and families as a whole, through creation of forum theatre, debates and dialogue this gives them an opportunity to share their own experiences7.

Field(s) of activity:         1. Education: We use Physical education which is an integral part of educational program design to promote the optimum development of an individual physically, socially, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually through total body movement in the performance of properly selected physical activities. It is a process by which changes in the individual are brought about through movement#s experiences and it aims not only at physical development but is also concerned with education of the whole person through physical activities.       2. Hygiene and sanitation: Sanitation refers to public health conditions related to clean drinking water and adequate treatment and disposal of human excreta and sewage. Preventing human contact with feces is part of sanitation, as is hand washing with soap. Sanitation systems aim to protect human health by providing a clean environment that will stop the transmission of disease, especially through the fecal#oral route. For example, diarrhea, a main cause of malnutrition and stuntedgrowth in children, can be reduced through sanitation. There are many other diseases which are easily transmitted in communities that have low levels of sanitation, such as ascariasis (a type of intestinal worm infection or helminthiasis), cholera, hepatitis, polio, schistosomiasis, trachoma, to name just a few      3. Peace building awareness programs: Peacebuilding is an activity that aims to resolve injustice in nonviolent ways and to transform the cultural &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; structural conditions that generate deadly or destructive conflict. It revolves around developing constructive personal, group, and political relationships across ethnic, religious, class, national, and racial boundaries. This process includes violence prevention; conflict management, resolution, or transformation; and post-conflict reconciliation or trauma healing, i.e., before, during and after war.We are currently in Imvepi refugee settlement, but with a plan to reach Rhino and Bidibidi settlementsWho are the social actors that benefit from the work? We target youth, (men, women, girls and boys)4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING:       We work directly with the office of the prime minster who is a principle representative of the government on ground, the church leaders, and local chiefs andalready established associations including the line ministries. These actors are supporters of our programs and they act like technical advisors in the day today running of community activities.5. FUNCTIONAL ORGANISATIONAL CHART       In the current board of director, out of seven members, the three are female. We have the Director who is a male and the program manager, while the position of the finance is a female , While the community mobilisers are a mixture of both male and female altogether.6.CURRENT BALANCE SHEET/FINANCIAL POSITION       We have not yet received much funding as a newly established organization apart from being funded on activities basis. This means we always relay on the contribution of our members and the volunteers.</narrative>
