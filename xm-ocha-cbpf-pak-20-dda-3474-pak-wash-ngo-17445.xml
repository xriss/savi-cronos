  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian crisis in Districts of Sanghar and Badin is getting worse due to rain flood 2020 causing approximately 400 thousands rural people living in both districts flood affected areas in accessing water and sanitation facilities. Taluka Khipro of district Sanghar is the largest Taluka of the country and has two distinct geographical portions: i.e. the irrigated area in the north and west and the desert in the south and east. All the eleven sub units (union councils) of Taluka Khipro in irrigated area are officially declared as Calamity Effected Areas in district of Sanghar. Whereas as Badin is also flood prone area and is heavily effected by Floods 2020 and is declared calamity hit area. Access to portable water remains of high concern and is intensified by the needs of livestock animals. Moreover, due to stagnant rain flood waters in Districts of Sanghar and Badin,  communities are displaced from their villages and have taken temporary shelters in camps (managed by district Govt:) and on road sides and flood bund embankments 

According to Rapid Needs Assessment 2020 conducted by UN in backdrop of Rain emergency, around 2.2 million people have been directly or indirectly been affected by the flooding with 77,337 houses fully damaged and 137,007 partially damaged in 15,233 villages.  In total, 196 relief camps have been established which are providing shelter to 23,629 people. Additionally, it is estimated that 1.9 million acres of crops have been affected and 45,961 loss of livestock. The Humanitarian Country Team through allocated Pakistan Humanitarian Pooled Fund (PHPF) through reserved allocation has announced to provide urgent humanitarian assistance for rain flood affected communities in four districts of Sindh Province including district of Sanghar and Badin in the sectors of WASH and Food Security.

The proposed project focuses on addressing the emergency WASH needs of 112,975 displaced/affected people. SAFWCO proposed action aims to respond to reduce the mortality and morbidity of flood affected populations through the provision of lifesaving water, sanitation and hygiene related interventions in Taluka Khipro, district of Sanghar and Taluka and District Badin. 

Gender will be mainstreamed all throughout the project cycle. SAFWCO will retain capacity to respond to WASH related crises in Districts of Sanghar and Badin for a maximum of 03 months. Widespread safe hygiene practice education will be provided to women through hygiene promotion session along with sessions on significance of hand washing at Household level with cross cutting awareness on prevention of COVID-19.</narrative>
