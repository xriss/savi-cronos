  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to draft of HNO 2020 issued by OCHA ,5.7 million children are in need of protection, with key need drivers including: ongoing exposure to hostilities, specifically in north-west and north-east Syria limited access to services and displacement, frequently separating children from family members, including primary caregivers, and disrupting education. 2.45 million children aged 5&#x2013;17 are out of school, heightening their protection risks
were reported to have been recruited by parties to the conflict. Cases of torture, detention, abduction, sexual violence, denial of and lack of access to humanitarian assistance due to lack of civil documentation, among other factors, were reported

Incidents of girls and boys being married off at young ages and withdrawn from school in order to work, often in dangerous conditions, were also observed
The needs assessment which have done by AHF  indicate that there are vulnerability points with the children and primary care providers  associated with the direct risks of worst forms of child labor, disability, physical / psychological injuries, severe neglect, family separation (including expected separation due to COVID19), child recruitment and child marriage.

The project aims to reduce the protection risks for displaced children and the host community in northwestern Syria in line with the minimum standards for child protection by expanding the services provided at the AHF Center in Janoudiya by increasing the interventions of the following child protection activities:
1.	Raise awareness between the women, men and children about CP issues through mobile teams
2.	Implement case management services that address the children&apos;s vulnerabilities and primary care providers associated with the direct risks of the worst forms of child labor, disability, physical / psychological injuries, severe neglect, family separation (including expected separation due to COVID19), child recruitment and child marriage. These services will be provided by workers specialized in case management through the AHF Center
3.	Building the capacities of child protection workers in case management.
Child protection activities will be implemented in the Janoudiya area in Jisr Al-Shughour and the surround area, and the project will target host communities, IDPs and returnees, community centers and  camps. The center will be served the most vulnerable children. All activities are in line with the Humanitarian Response Plan 2020 in addition to the strategic objectives of the Protection Cluster and the SCHF allocation paper. The services will be provided for one year
The project will coordinate with the affected population and stakeholders and it had been designed to strengthen gender balance. 
The project aims to include children with special needs, and all activities will be carried out according to the recommendations of the protection cluster and WHO in order to deal with Covid-19 and the preventive measures required to protect beneficiaries and humanitarian workers.
The project will be monitored by the MampE team, in order to monitor the progress of the project and ensure activities are implementing according to the work plan and agreed indicators.
The project will ensure accountability of the affected population and stakeholders through transparency of accountability, the complaints mechanism, the feedback mechanism, and the monitoring of worker efficiency</narrative>
