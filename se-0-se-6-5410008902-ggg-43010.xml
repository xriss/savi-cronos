   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to address COVID-19
The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) is an international health research institution located in Dhaka, dedicated to addressing the health challenges that disproportionately affect people living in poverty in Bangladesh and other low- and middle-income countries. Sida has supported icddr,b since 1981, and the institute has evolved considerably over time. The institute is today a centre of excellence producing research of global relevance, such as child and maternal health, including reproductive health. Icddr,b provides unique opportunities to address health challenges in low-income settings through low-cost, practical, lifesaving solutions. The track record includes the oral rehydration solution (ORS), zinc for diarrhoea treatment and tetanus vaccines for newborns, which have saved and continue to save millions of lives worldwide. icddr,b has the capacity to undertake a full spectrum of research spanning population-based studies and demographic surveillance, large-scale clinical trials, hospital-based clinical studies, and laboratory research. icddr,b has recently had some turbulent years with concerns of both organizational nature and regarding research sustainability, especially with regards to the regrowth of researchers at the senior level. These challenges are being addressed in different ways and the institute is currently at a transitional stage.

icddr,b&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2015-2018 reinforces icddr,b&#x2019;s legacy of focusing not just on discovery, but also on strengthening the organisation&#x2019;s ability to shape policy at the national, regional and global level, as well as advocating for the use of highly effective products and evidence-based discoveries. icddr,b reinforces these efforts through publishing and South-South collaboration, training and capacity-building, and continues to build a cadre of public health experts and capacities for low- and middle-income countries. In addition, strategic national, regional and global partnerships tap into the complementary assets of other organisations&#x2014;academic, scientific, NGOs and private sector&#x2014;to maximise the influence and reach of icddr,b&#x2019;s work.

There are five key areas in which icddr,b has a strong track record and expertise (points 1-5 below) and two which are highly relevant to Bangladesh and where icddr,b would like to develop greater expertise (points 6-7 below):
1	Reduce maternal and neonatal mortality
2	Prevent and treat maternal and childhood malnutrition 
3	Control enteric and respiratory infections 
4	Detect and control emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases
5	Achieve universal health coverage
6	Non Communicable Diseases
7	Climate Change

The Strategic Plan has identified the need for regrowth of the scientific base, and aim to invest in the capacity building of junior and mid-level scientists through mentoring, training, travel and exchange opportunities. This will increase the overall capacity of the institution, create a cadre of researchers with leadership potential and ensure a new generation of scientist have a strong knowledge and skill set.

A new phase of research cooperation support to icddr,b is proposed for the period July 2016 - December 2020. The research funding is proposed to be used to fund research and capacity building targeting junior and mid-level scientists in line with icddr,b&#x2019;s Strategic Plan. Although icddr,b is successful in attracting financing, the Swedish research support has the added value to provide support in line with the institution&#x2019;s own strategic priorities including the continued capacity development of its staff. The proposal is to ensure the smooth transition from an older to a younger generation of scientists and addressing the research priorities identified in the Strategic Plan. In addition to the capacity building there is support to the finalisation of the establishment of a genomics facility, which was initiated in 2015. This facility forms the basis for innovative research and attracts international collaboration. 

An important value of the Sida research support is the earmarking of research project funding to younger scientists and a possibility to plan a career development program of several years in a row. Another added value according to icddr,b is the relationship to Sida also as advisors, not just funders, who can support in developing processes and criteria for the calls and experience-sharing in capacity building. Sida strongly supports the ownership of icddr,b and collaboration with both South and North, which increases the potential of icddr,b researchers to attract international funding and hence the basis for icddr,b&apos;s sustainability. 

There are several interesting synergies between the support to icddr,b and other initiatives, both at the Embassy and at Sida, including WASH (water and sanitation) and INDEPTH (Network of demographic surveillance site, where icddr,b is an important member). Considering that Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to climate change, likely to experience floods in the wet season and droughts in the dry season, as well as the high likelihood to experience extreme weather events, there are concerns that this may affect health in several different ways (polluted or dirty waters; increase of vector-borne diseases, reduction of crop production leading to undernutrition). For these reasons, Sida also foresees that icddr,b may become a model for climate change adaptation.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att bek&#xE4;mpa covid-19
International Center of Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) &#xE4;r ett internationellt center som producerar forskning av stor relevans och av god kvalitet. Namnet till trots bedrivs forskning p&#xE5; diverse omr&#xE5;den ut&#xF6;ver just de viktiga diarr&#xE9;sjukdomarna, inkluderandes m&#xF6;dra- och sp&#xE4;dbarnsh&#xE4;lsa. 

Insatsen avser programst&#xF6;d under perioden 2016-2020 till icddr,b. Det f&#xF6;reslagna st&#xF6;det &#xE4;r en forts&#xE4;ttning p&#xE5; tidigare st&#xF6;d, vilket f&#xF6;rl&#xE4;ngdes med aktivitetsperiod till 30 juni 2016. Det f&#xF6;reslagna totala beloppet &#xE4;r 30 500 000 SEK f&#xF6;r perioden 2016-2020. St&#xF6;det fr&#xE5;n Sida &#xE4;r programst&#xF6;d till kapacitets&#xF6;kning hos unga forskare i enlighet med deras Strategiska Plan 2015-2018, vilket &#xE4;r en f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttning f&#xF6;r den flexibilitet som kr&#xE4;vs f&#xF6;r att kunna anpassa aktiviteterna efter behov och erfarenhet. Sida &#xE4;r f&#xF6;r n&#xE4;rvarande den enda givaren som st&#xF6;djer denna del av strategin specifikt. 

Icddr,b har m&#xE5;ls&#xE4;ttningen att utveckla l&#xF6;sningar inom h&#xE4;lsa som &#xE4;r kostnadseffektiva och realistiska f&#xF6;r fattiga m&#xE4;nniskor som lever i l&#xE5;ginkomstmilj&#xF6;er. Icddr,b &#xE4;r idag ett framst&#xE5;ende center f&#xF6;r forskning av global relevans, exempelvis barn- och m&#xF6;drav&#xE5;rd samt reproduktiv h&#xE4;lsa. De arbetar utifr&#xE5;n ett starkt r&#xE4;ttighetsperspektiv och st&#xE4;ller den fattiga m&#xE4;nniskan i centrum f&#xF6;r sitt arbete. De planerar och investerar i l&#xE5;ngsiktiga h&#xE4;lsoinsatser och har en r&#xE5;dgivande funktion inom bla WHO. 

icddr,b har utvecklat m&#xE5;nga processer och produkter av stor betydelse f&#xF6;r h&#xE4;lsa i l&#xE5;ginkomstmilj&#xF6;er, till exempel ett v&#xE4;rldsledande koleravaccin och v&#xE4;tskeers&#xE4;ttningen ORS. Nyligen har de tagit fram en enkel-dos av koleravaccinet, en l&#xE5;gkostnads-luftpump f&#xF6;r sm&#xE5;barn med lunginflammation och stelkrampsvaccin f&#xF6;r nyf&#xF6;dda. 

M&#xE5;ls&#xE4;ttningarna i icddr,b&apos;s Strategiska Plan 2015-2018 &#xE4;r att bli ett v&#xE4;rldsledande center inom forskning p&#xE5; global h&#xE4;lsa, och att bygga en b&#xE4;ttre och effektivare finansiellt h&#xE5;llbar institution.  

De fem strategiska prioriteringarna &#xE4;r:
1. Minska m&#xF6;dra- och sp&#xE4;dbarnsd&#xF6;dlighet
2. F&#xF6;rebygga och behandla undern&#xE4;ring hos m&#xF6;drar och barn
3. Kontroll av enteriska- och luftv&#xE4;gsinfektioner
4. Uppt&#xE4;cka och f&#xF6;rebygga nya och &#xE5;terkommande infektionssjukdomar
5. Uppn&#xE5; allm&#xE4;n/universell sjukv&#xE5;rdsf&#xF6;rs&#xE4;kring 

Ut&#xF6;ver dessa fem omr&#xE5;den, d&#xE4;r icddr,b &#xE4;r internationellt konkurrenskraftiga, vill man bygga upp starkare kapacitet inom omr&#xE5;dena: h&#xE4;lsoeffekter av klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar, samt f&#xF6;rebyggande och behandling av icke smittsamma sjukdomar. I Bangladesh har man en unik m&#xF6;jlighet att studera just kopplingen mellan h&#xE4;lsa och klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringar. 

Det svenska st&#xF6;det &#xE4;r inte stort j&#xE4;mf&#xF6;rt med de riktade forskningsanslag som centret attraherar, men det svenska forskningsst&#xF6;det ger ett stort merv&#xE4;rde och kan anses katalytiskt. &#xC4;garskapet f&#xF6;r insatsen ligger i linje med centrets strategiska plan. D&#xE5; majoriteten av forskningsmedel &#xE4;r &#xF6;ronm&#xE4;rkta av finansi&#xE4;rerna &#xE4;r det f&#xF6;reslagna svenska st&#xF6;det av st&#xF6;rsta vikt f&#xF6;r centret d&#xE5; det m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r l&#xE5;ngsiktiga satsningar som f&#xF6;ljer centrets egna prioriteringar. Fokus ligger p&#xE5; &#xE5;terv&#xE4;xten av framtida starka forskningsledare p&#xE5; centret &#x2013; n&#xE5;got som dels m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r icddr,b&#x2019;s framtid, dels st&#xE4;rker forskningsomr&#xE5;det i sig. Sida kan g&#xF6;ra st&#xF6;rst skillnad genom ett fler&#xE5;rigt st&#xF6;d som m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r en satsning p&#xE5; unga lovande forskare, vilka annars har sv&#xE5;rt att f&#xE5; extern finansiering i konkurrens med etablerade seniora forskare. Dessa unga lovande forskare v&#xE4;lj ut i konkurrens och m&#xE5;ste vara anst&#xE4;llda som forskare vid icddr,b och vara under 40 &#xE5;r. St&#xF6;det kommer &#xE4;ven att g&#xE5; till etableringen av icddr,b&#x2019;s genomikfacilitet vilken initierades med svenskt st&#xF6;d under 2015-2016. 

Sida har gett finansiellt st&#xF6;d till icddr,b sedan 1981 och har erfarenheten att centret har god kapacitet att uppn&#xE5; sina m&#xE5;l.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, the support to icddr,b from the Swedish Embassy in Dhaka had phased out, with the exception of a training in intellectual property rights (IPR) and the initiation of an evaluation (joint by Embassy and FORSK). This was also true for spring 2020. In addition to the research support, additional support from Sida SOCIAL was initiated and activities started in May 2020. Reporting for this component is done separately, as it is handled by SOCIAL. An interim report was assessed in June 2020. Related to the covid-19 pandemic, there are a lot of delays in the &#x201C;original&#x201D; programme, but also some interesting new results and initiatives, and even an improvement when it comes to some training programmes. The pandemic is still ongoing (Aug 2020) and there are a lot of uncertainties of future activities. At icddr,b a major part of staff and activities are directed towards supporting Bangladesh. Researchers, who are often also clinicians or nurses, have put their research on hold in benefit of serving as health personnel. According to our main contact at icddr,b, Bangladesh is the most impacted country when it comes to fatalities of health staff due to lack of protective gear (PPE). There are also several icddr,b professionals who have deceased in the past few months. In addition to these challenges, a third of the country is flooded. Icddr,b support the Government in the analysis of covid-19 infections, and have tested 48&#xA0;154 samples as of Aug 18th, in part from 9 different district-level hospitals. They also do community surveillance and different research projects to inform policies/strategies as well as developing methods to limit the spread and impact of the disease. icddr,b were selected to conduct the third-phase trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed by China&apos;s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.&#xA0;As Sida provides funding from global strategies, we cannot support work that is directly targeting Bangladesh without the possibility to also benefit other countries. But icddr,b also has the possibility to contribute to the global pool of knowledge and innovation, and the support from SOCIAL has a special focus on these issues, with a focus on WASH and urban settings. The research support is used in projects and trainings that can still take place virtually, as well as two additional projects which were approved after one researcher had to leave her project: - &#x201C;Optimising the treatment of COVID-19 adults with severe pneumonia and/or ARDS in Bangladesh&#x201D;, using an adaptive version of locally made Bubble CPAP. The nasal interface needs to be adapted (to minimize potential nasal leakage of oxygen during the delivery of oxygen to adult COVID 19 affected patients and simultaneously to attain adequate positive airway pressure). It took engineers almost two months to prepare this adaptive nasal interface as during the COVID 19 crisis it took more time to arrange silicon materials to prepare the nasal interface (with 3D interpretation) with the help of local plastic company. The research protocol is now with the icddr,b Research Review Committee and Ethical Review Committee, and they are planning to start the design and safety phases of the study by the end of September. - &#x201C;Clinical evaluation of a point-of-need diagnostic system for detection of COVID-19 towards its deployment at peripheral health care settings&#x201D;, where lab works for initial validation and optimization of the laboratory SOPs. Meanwhile, all RNA samples from 100 COVID-19 patients have been retrieved, as well as equal number of controls, and the experimentation will start in the coming month. Training takes place by digital means, and interestingly this has been received very well. Some citations from the online training on Research Protocol Development: &#x201C;The COVID-19 situation has created an intense mental pressure on all of us. The vigorous discussions, intense group work, supervision by the faculties throughout the course has relieved the anxiety by taking off our mind from all the negative news of the pandemic. This positive mental health is another side of this training I am grateful for&#x201D;, &#x201C;I am working in icddr,b for almost 10 years, but in the field. For the last 10 years I couldn&#x2019;t join any capacity building program. Thanks to Sida, Research Administration and TTU to arrange this online course. Only for being an online course, I was able to join and I have learnt so many things&#x201D;, and &#x201C;I have participated in a lot of face-to-face training. Usually in a face-to-face training, one or two trainees dominate participation throughout the training.&#xA0; The aspect I love about this is that there is no first or last benchers in online training. Everyone can participate and speak out their mind with the same level of comfort&#x201D;. An external evaluation of icddr,b was finalised in spring of 2020, with quite a few important comments regarding the research programme. The evaluation and Sida&#x2019;s response is found in a separate file in Trac. The evaluation was financed jointly by the Embassy and FORSK, and evaluated both core support and research support. In general terms, it was a positive evaluation, clearly showing the importance of the center. The capacity building programme and the training are both important and successful programmes. Criticism was mainly regarding the underutilisation of the genomics facility, and although progress is being done it is important to follow the progress. In times of covid-19 the need for a national/regional resources is clear. Selected results from 2019: Icddr,b general Each year, millions of severely malnourished children fail to recover completely, remaining stunted and sickly even after they are well fed. Ten years of research has pointed to a root cause: Their gut microbes do not mature. 2019, an international team built on that research to come up with a low-cost, easy-to-obtain supplement that preferentially stimulates the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. The supplements performed well in a small trial, and larger scale clinical trials are now underway to see how well the supplement works to prevent stunting.&#xA0; Many countries will not be able to achieve the SDGs for malnutrition, according to icddr,b. As a result their brains do not develop properly and they remain susceptible to diseases for many years after. This is due to their gut microbes which remain in an immature state.&#xA0; Scientists from icddr,b and Washington University investigated the impact of diets on the gut microbiota, and how members of microbiota that are beneficial are affected positively. Another key outcome of this study was to see the effect of diets on proteins produced in the body of the children. These results were recognised as one of top ten scientific breakthroughs in 2019 by Science magazine (https://vis.sciencemag.org/breakthrough2019/finalists/#Microbes-combat) Sida support to young promising scientists Icddr,b writes in its report that &#x201C;Sida support has in the past played a catalytic role for icddr,b; specially since it supports the young and upcoming researchers who otherwise finds it difficult to secure competitive funding from external sources at the beginning of their scientific career. It&#x2019;s a unique mechanism of support as it gives icddr,b management the opportunity to invest in research areas of the Strategic Plan for which external funding is scarce. Sida&#x2019;s project support has also aided in the career development of young scientists as funds can be budgeted for support from external experts on specific areas to assist them with their projects. Fund is also provided to young researchers for attending workshop/seminar to present their findings and data. This gives young researchers exposure and networking opportunity.&#x201D; The selection of projects was done differently than the previous round, as decided by icddr,b&apos;s Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and discussed with Sida. The reason was to get better evaluations and feedback to the scientists. Each scientific division was asked to select the best five concepts from their divisions to allow those to be sent to the external scientific advisory group (SAG) for review. Each scientific division in icddr,b formed a gender balanced selection committee comprising of their senior and mid-level scientists and the applicants had to make a brief presentation to this committee. From this initial screening, a total number of 24 concept notes were short-listed out of which 11 were led by female researchers. This time it was much easier to get the target three reviews for each concept note from panel members of the SAG and as a result, it was easy to attain a meaningful average score for each application. Also, the reduced numbers made it possible for the SAG members to provide qualitative comments on the concept notes, which the young researchers always find very useful as guidance for future competition. With the available funding, it was possible to support 10 new projects out of which 4 were led by female scientists. The allocation of Sida funds based on a competitive peer- review process very successfully and this has been recognized not only by the young researchers at icddr,b but also by the Board, Senior Advisory Group (SAG) and senior management of icddr,b. As a result of this, icddr,b has now launched a similar competitive grant process for the young female researchers of icddr,b and beyond. The funding comes from a Prize awarded to icddr,b for its global impact. As an example of how Sida&#x2019;s funds for the young researchers plays a catalytic role in their career is &#x201C;the FluMI project&#x201D; led by a researcher who not only benefitted from the data generated from this study for his PhD thesis in Australia, but his collaboration with National Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases in Bangladesh later helped icddr,b in getting a multi-country project (IAMI). The researcher&#x2019;s successor at icddr,b is now surveying myocardial infarction patients for influenza and SARS-COV-2. Another example of interesting research results is presented in the last part of this text. Training Good to know is the long-term partnership since 2011between icddr,b and Uppsala University for their Infectious Disease Course Masters Program. Between 2011 and 2017, TTU has trained around 140 Masters level students from Uppsala. During 2019, to meet the training needs of young scientists, the newly formed &#x2018;Learning and Development Unit&#x2019; &#x2013; a team combined of TTU (Technical Training Unit) and TD (Talent Development) offered training courses on 10 topics in 13 batches and trained 290 participants out of whom 48% were female. However, the total number of applications received for these trainings were 630. This means that a huge unmet need is there among the young scientists at icddr,b for such in-house trainings. Icddr,b identified training needs and prioritized based on the following four criteria:&#xA0;*Unmet needs of previous years&apos; training; *Feedback from participants about their current needs; *Recommendations from the senior leadership team (SLT) and senior advisory group (SAG); *Data on training needs from performance management&#xA0;and&#xA0;development system (PMDS). Bubble CPAP The Bubble CPAP project with AHRI in Ethiopia completed its Phase I , but due to the delay in getting approval from the Ethiopian IRB for some amendments made to the original research protocol, which included changing a hospital because of not getting enough patients enrolled, the study progress got delayed. Genomics facility The external evaluation had a few critical comments on the genomics facility, and it is important to follow up on the progress. Especially the use was criticised. The centre is running both WGS and 16s metagenomics. Lately, the number of tests in the genomics center (GC) has gone up significantly. It went up from 131 in 2017 to 315 in 2019. The bioinformatics core at the GC is now consist of national and young scientists and it is no more dependent on hired international consultants. GC has been receiving samples from other national institutions such as East west university Bangladesh and Jessore University. The current performance rate is 62% and it was only 27% in 2017. The underutilization rate has dropped from 74% in 2017 to 38% now. The cost of the tests is now negotiable depending on the number of tests. &#xA0; An example of one of the finalised projects of young promising scientists: &#x201C;A study to systematically document the implementation related challenges of Shasthyo Suroksha Karmasuchi (SSK, Health Protection Scheme) of the Government of Bangladesh&#x201D;, a collaboration with two institutes in UK and Karolinska in Sweden. 18 months long and a budget of 85&#xA0;600 USD. &quot;The main aim of this study was to assess the implementation-related challenges of SSK scheme, and specifically challenges in below poverty line (BPL) population identification, barriers in the utilization of health services, and assessment of service knowledge among the beneficiaries. The results show that around 30% of the non-BPL household got included in the BPL list, in part because the listing is done seldomly. Since then, &#x201C;many of them got a job, and they are not poor anymore&#x201D;. The results also show that there is a lack of knowledge; among the surveyed SSK household, around 68% ever heard about the SSK scheme and 63% had knowledge about the process of healthcare provision under SSK scheme. However, a majority of the respondent didn&#x2019;t have knowledge that SSK provides free medicine (54%), free diagnostic (75%), and reimbursement of transportation cost for referral facilities (87%). The households members included in the survey, around 25% of them suffered from illness in the last three month. Among them, 82% utilized healthcare from different sources. However, only 8% of the patient utilized healthcare from SSK facility. The distance was found to be one of the major barriers to low utilization of SSK services from Kalihati UHC. A participant said &#x201C;Suppose, I am suffering from fever, for this, do I need to go to Kalihati spending fifty to one hundred takas for transport? The fever would go just if I buy medicine of fifty taka from the nearby pharmacy. Then why would I go to Kalihati spending one hundred taka?&#x201D; Findings have been shared with the Health Economics Unit, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and other implementing partners of SSK project. The study protocol has been published in BMC Health Services Research journal, and two more manuscripts are being prepared. The study findings will be useful to program managers for planning nation-wide scale-up of health financing scheme for below poverty level population in Bangladesh and similar other low-income country settings.&#xA0; A new research grant was received from the USAID&#x2019;s Research for Decision Makers project for evaluating the SSK health protection Scheme (US$ 352,798) for conducting evaluation of the pilot SSK scheme on reduction of out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure and increasing utilization of healthcare among enrolled member. The researcher attributes this to his experience on SSK scheme and existing collaboration with Health Economics Unit, which was supported with Sida funds.&quot;</narrative>
