   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Paradigm Initiative is a non-profit social enterprise that builds ICT-enabled support systems through our digital inclusion and digital rights program.
Our digital rights program is focused on the development of public policy for internet freedom in key regions of Africa, with offices in Abuja, Nigeria; Yaound&#xE9;, Cameroon; Lome, Togo; Arusha, Tanzania; and Lusaka, Zambia. Our policy advocacy efforts include media campaigns, litigation, coalition building, training,
research and report writing. We host the annual bilingual and pan-African Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (formerly known as Internet freedom Forum) that brings online rights enthusiasts and experts from across 35 African countries.
Paradigm Initiative also led the process of developing the Nigerian Digital Rights and Freedom Bill that now only awaits presidential assent. The organization has become a leading expert and go-to institution on the subject of online rights in Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of this project is to increase awareness and respect for online freedom of expression by carrying out activities that educate, inform, influence and support implementation of policies, laws and practices on the subject matter. This project will address the identified problem by constructively engaging relevant stakeholders on said subject; organizing information sessions, discussions and training for the judiciary and law enforcement agencies; organizing awareness training and workshops for media practitioners and ordinary citizens; employing effective advocacy strategies to ensure that proposed legislation that hurt freedom of expression are not passed; influencing the passage of positive rights legislation; utilizing the Freedom of Information Act to formally seek information regarding actual or potential freedom of expression infringements; instituting lawsuits against violators of online freedom of expression; and creating a systematic way of identifying, reporting and addressing violations of rights to freedom of expression online. The project is expected to significantly change the overall outlook towards digital
engagement in Nigeria. It will reduce the climate of fear around freedom of expression online and will create safe
spaces for dissidents, disadvantaged groups and minority groups who face huge discrimination on the basis of their opinion, beliefs or sexuality.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">60 judges at different levels of Nigeria&#x2019;s court system, 100 Law enforcements officers across different agencies and 100 civil society actors including the media. This project will employ strategic litigation to seek redress for at least 20 cases of violations of freedom of expression online rights in Nigeria and will work with the National Human Rights Commission to put in place a system of documenting and responding to violations
of right to freedom of expression online.</narrative>
