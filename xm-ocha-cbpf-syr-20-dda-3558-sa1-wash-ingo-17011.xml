   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this proposed project, SIF will participate in improving the WASH infrastructure in some of the highest severity communities in, Rural Damascus (Kafarbatna, Kisweh) and Daraa (Sheikh Miskeen) which in turn will participate in taking the needed measures to prevent further spread of COVID-19 by providing clean water for drinking and domestic use. Moreover, SIF plans to provide waste bins to allow better disposal of garbage and reduce the amount of infection caused by the existence of garbage in streets. SIF WASH team conducted an in-depth technical assessment in July 2020 which showed that WASH infrastructure - such as water and sewage pipes - was severely damaged, resulting in the mixing and dumping of wastewater. in water source or flooding the streets, thus contaminating the soil and the overall management of water resources. According to 2020 HNO, 23% of waste is disposed of inappropriately in communities and at least 80% of wastewater is discharged without treatment, while at least half of sewage systems are not functional across the country. SIF decided to implement the project through the following activities that will be implemented in accordance with the guidelines of the WASH Sector to ensure a successful sustainable intervention


-	Borehole Rehabilitation (Rural Damascus).
-	Sewage system rehabilitation (Rural Damascus).

-	Solid waste bins distribution and debris removal and garbage disposal (Rural Damascus and Daraa).

The intervention will mainly consist in replacing sewage pipes, excavating manholes, supplying and installing submersible pumps, in addition to installing generators for the boreholes.
The sewage system rehabilitation will benefit 23,000 individuals in Rural Damascus and 3825 in Hama. As for the boreholes rehabilitation, it will benefit 60,000 individuals in Rural Damascus. Whereas the debris removal will benefit 20,000 in Rural Damascus. Moreover, the distribution of waste bins will benefit 60,000 individuals in Rural Damascus and 35,000 in Daraa.
The above-mentioned &#xFB01;gures are based on preliminary estimations and could change during the implementation.

SIF will rely on a contractor to rehabilitate sewage networks, boreholes and drinking water networks. Contractor selection will be based on SIF Standards of Procedures (SoPs) in order to ensure transparency and accountability of the selection process. Composed of skilled and experienced engineers, SIF WASH technical team will supervise contractor teams on daily basis in order to ensure the quality delivery of planned works. Contractors will also be asked to provide a period of guarantee in order to ensure the sustainability of the works. Furthermore, to provide a livelihood opportunity for people from the targeted communities, SIF will ask the contractors through a contractual obligation to include qualified workers in implementing the works in order for them to generate income and support their families.  

Coordination with administrative and community-based local entities has been considered as a priority by SIF to ensure the sustainability of the action. As part of the design of the proposed project, Executive Office of the governorate, Ministry of Local Affair, SARC and representatives from the local community were consulted by SIF in order to assess the needs, design the project implementation and avoid any overlapping with planned rehabilitation projects at community level.</narrative>
