   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Assistance in preparing communities for winterization in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to distance education</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project involves the support of people living in NGCA of Donetsk region who have faced specific problems caused by winter conditions, including the growing rate of spread of COVID-19. It is planned to provide humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable groups of the population through the multicluster intervention: residents of rural areas, children (including children with specific needs), pensioners, IDPs, as well as people in penitentiary institutions (including those without a court sentence and in pre-trial detention centers). At the same time, humanitarian intervention is planned to be implemented as an incentive to develop the resilience of local communities by reducing dependence on humanitarian assistance (as one of the elements of nexus)
The project is supposed to:
1) Provision of construction materials for the working crews of Novoazovskiy and Yasinovatskiy districts &#x2013; distribution of construction materials to existing working crews in order to carry out internal repair work in private households and social institutions. It is a continuation of our joint project with UHF &quot;Rod for Donbass&quot;. It is also planned to contribute to the restoration of the Yasinovatskiy collective center, which accommodates IDPs from Krutaya Balka.
2) Self-organization of communities for the purpose of mutual assistance with the household items &quot;Shelf of Kindness&quot; in 5 rural districts. Installation of 5 in each district shelves based on palaces of culture or social institutions for the elderly. At the moment, the &quot;Shelf of Kindness&quot; exists on the basis of the office of the organization in Donetsk, a large stock of things has been formed, which can be transported to the Shelfs in these locations.
3) 10 cases to help primary educational institutions (kindergartens and junior school premises): repairs (preparation for winter), equipment and soft inventory. Priority for transferring outdoor toilets to premises.
4) Agricultural support: providing feed, greenhouses, agricultural equipment, etc. for the possibility of self-sufficiency in winter. Target groups: people over 60 years old, unemployed (with the aim of preventing their marginalization and militarization), people with specific needs, IDPs.
5) Support for people who stay in penitentiary institutions. Provision of disinfectants to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and hygiene kits, including sanitary pads for female colony.
6) Promotion of distance education - supporting schools and school communities with equipment and other materials for continuing education in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to distance education.. 

As a result of its implementation, qualitative changes are expected:
1) Preservation of the functioning of the work crews formed on the basis of the districts, restoration of housing and social infrastructure with the help of these crews, including those institutions that are designed to accommodate displaced persons from destroyed and / or isolated settlements near the line of contact.
2) Scaling and popularization of the tool for mutual assistance &quot;Shelf of Kindness&quot; by the community members in rural areas of NGCA Donetsk region
3) Preparation for the winter period of 10 primary educational institutions: repair, insulation, provision of the equipment and soft inventory. Priority will be given to the institutions with the street toilets in the framework of the project it is planned to transfer them inside, as well as gender-sensitive toilet facilities (such as MHM hygiene) and inclusive personal hygiene needs.
4) Increased food security due to resource assistance to agricultural households in winter.
5) Increase the safety of persons stay in penitentiary institutions and the staff.
6) Schools whose communities do not have the opportunity to purchase equipment and materials for distance learning will be able to avoid discrimination against their students and integrate them into the educational process.</narrative>
