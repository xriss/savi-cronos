       <narrative xml:lang="EN">On an Outcome-level, the first year of the project has seen important developments in regard to establishing procedures and working methods which enhance a transparent decision-making process, as well as building upon and reinforcing national institutional arrangements making these not only more effective by example but also increasing sustainability of the efforts. As example, the project has developed a prioritization system to select locations for survey and clearance based on humanitarian and development priorities which can clearly show how areas have been selected.
Through close engagement with the Provincial People&#x2019;s committees, District and Commune authorities the project has contributed to target communities having increased information about the level of UXO contamination, and steps taking to address the issue. A collaboration with provincial Red Cross offices has also ensure that ongoing MRE activities will reach out to each village in the 2018 target area.

On Output-level, especially due to the good and result-oriented collaboration in the JPMU the project has been able to start the largest component on survey and clearance in not less than 21 locations in Quang Binh (6 locations) and Binh Dinh (15 locations) contributing to human development in contaminated districts. Other components on MRE and VA have finalized elaborate work plans to support the efforts in contaminated areas from the beginning of 2019.
&#xF076;	Strong project management set-up, which ensures clear decision-making processes for the entire project in the JPCC, close coordination of day-to-day operation of the project in the JPMU, as well as a well-established approach for addressing technical issues in smaller groups and with participation of both UNDP/KOICA and VNMAC staff, and as needed other technical experts; Close coordination throughout 2018 with similar interventions through arrangement of related forums (KV-MAP Technical Meeting in May, Provincial Coordination Meeting with DoFA, PMC and INGOs in Quang Binh in October and participation in many other meetings), as well as direct collaboration on a number of issues for greater synergy and multiplier effect among interventions (most importantly STA project on overall coordination and approach, as well as IM, but also with NPA on new TS procedures and LWCC, MAG on MRE and prioritization of S&amp;C in Quang Binh, CRS on MRE, IC on VA and Golden West on EOD and BAC &#x2013; see also section 4.3). The work in the LWG on the joint Capacity Development Work Plan is also worth mentioning this connection;

&#xF076;	The approved Procurement Plan for 2018 have been completed including major equipment for effective operation of JPMU, site management units and S&amp;C teams in the field such as mine &amp; bomb detectors, GISs, radios, laptops, printers, ArcGis software, medical supply for S&amp;C teams, etc. The equipment is in the process of security check and will be delivered to the field soonest;
&#xF076;	Agreement has been reached on integrating the KV-MAP with the ongoing effort, supported by NPA and WRA, to build a national Information Management system (based on IMSMA 6). Site Management Units (sub-PMUs) have been established in both provinces and they already serve as hubs for coordination of all teams, and efforts are ongoing to further strengthen this with involvement of provincial PMC staff within these two offices;
&#xF076;	Establishment of a Prioritization System for S&amp;C based on humanitarian and development priorities which has been used to identify target areas in both provinces and resulting in more than 4,600 ha already having undergone survey;
&#xF076;	Issuance of the IM regulations for KVMAP which will serve as the guidance for setting up and implementation of information activities from S&amp;C teams to the provincial site management units and the database centers at VNMAC as well as coordinate information in MRE and victim assistance toward the expected mine action database.
&#xF076;	Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey completed, which will form the basis for a more targeted approach to MRE;
&#xF076;	Decision on utilizing UXO Victim Data Base for registration, including self-registration, and case management.</narrative>
