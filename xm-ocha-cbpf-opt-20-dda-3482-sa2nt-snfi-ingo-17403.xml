   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Protection of most vulnerable households in Southern Gaza Strip through winterization and rehabilitation of substandard houses.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action aims to contribute to protection of the most vulnerable people living in substandard shelters through creating safe, adequate, and healthy living environment in southern Gaza Strip. It will help the highly vulnerable HHs living in substandard shelters have access to safe, adequate, and healthy living environment through winterization solutions and basic shelter rehabilitation.
The action was designed by Islamic relief and its local partners (BAYADER and UFA) who are currently working together in the ongoing humanitarian interventions targeting over 2000 households in the southern Gaza Strip. 


The action includes two key components: 

(1) Winterization and light repair of houses for 234 houses (94 Deir Al-Balah, 77 Khan Younis, 63 Rafah): Cash assistance at an average of $ 400 per HHs (based on identified technical needs at each house) for essential non-food items, light repairs, and adaptations of substandard housing conditions where the HHs will be oriented and advised to implement the prioritized activities such as repairs of roofs, broken windows, closing holes and fixing cracks in the walls etc, in addition to purchasing the needed essential non-food items including sterilizing and hygiene items, sealing off kit (Nylon, Tarpaulin sheet, tape), bedding kits, winter clothes , etc. 

(2) Rehabilitation of substandard housing units and essential NFIs for 100 houses (40 Deir Al-Balah, 33 Khan Younis, 27 Rafah): Cash assistance at an average of $1,763 per HHs (based on identified technical needs at each house) for rehabilitation of substandard housing units where the HHs will be oriented and advised to do the priority rehabilitation such as roofs, windows, doors, fixing toilets and kitchens, etc. Also, HHs will purchase the needed shelter NFI packages including bedding items (Blanket, Mattress, Mat), winter clothes, and/or kitchen sets, as well as basic Hygiene items to protect family members from COVID-19. 
The project will be managed by IRPAL humanitarian program team with substantial delegation of the major interventions on the ground to the local partners BAYADER and UFA.

The following is a list of key activities showing roles of each party (in brackets).
- Finalize selection of 234 beneficiaries for winterization and light repair and preparation of bills of quantities (IRPAL and partners)
- Conduct orientation and communication with beneficiaries regarding NFIs kits (partners)
- Provide financial and technical support to HHs to implement winterization and light repair and purchase NFIs kits (IRPAL and partners)
- Conduct health promotion (partners)
- Conduct MEAL activities and post distribution monitoring (IRPAL and partners)
- Finalize selection of 100 beneficiaries for rehabilitation of substandard housing units and preparation of bills of quantities (IRPAL and partners)
- Conduct orientation and communication with beneficiaries related to shelter rehabilitation (partners)
- Provide financial and technical support to 100 HHs to rehabilitate / renovate / adapt their substandard houses through self-help approach (IRPAL and partners)
- Conduct MEAL activities and post distribution monitoring (IRPAL and partners)
- Conduct administrative and financial closure (IRPAL and Partners)

The long experience and operational capacity of IRPAL and its local partners in the field of humanitarian actions in general and the shelter sector in particular, makes them best suited to implement the project to the highest level of quality and accountability to the stakeholder i.e. donor and beneficiaries with best utilizing the value for money (highest level of economy, efficiency and effectiveness) and adopting best practices and guidance by the shelter cluster guidelines as well IRPAL shelter guidelines, as well as high level of coordination with related ministries and peer organizations.
The action is &#x201C;time critical&#x201D; and should be implemented as soon as possible in advance of winter season.</narrative>
