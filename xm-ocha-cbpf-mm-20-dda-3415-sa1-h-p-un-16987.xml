   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of integrated SRHR and Primary Health Care services to displaced people from IDP camps and remote villages in Kachin State through mobile clinics</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to improve and expand the accessibility of primary health care including sexual and reproductive health (SRHR) services to internally displaced people (IDP) and conflict affected vulnerable communities in Kachin State based on needs identified by the Health Cluster. GBV (gender based violence), and MHPSS (mental health psychosocial support) services will be integrated into the service package, building upon UNFPA&#x2019;s ongoing efforts with Myanmar Medical Association (MMA) to more holistically meet the needs of the conflict-affected women, men, girls and boys in Kachin State. 


Based on lessons learned from UNFPA&#x2019;s current support to MMA, the project will delivery SRHR services to IDP camps and host communities using two mobile clinic teams deployed to 4 townships (Waingmaw, Mansi, Shwegu and Chipwe) in Kachin State. MMA currently has MHF funding to operate two mobile teams until end of August 2020 the current request is for additional funds to cover the full project including operation of the mobile teams from September 2020 until the end of August 2021 shifting coverage to townships prioritized in the most recent MHF call for proposals. 


The service package includes SRHR services prioritized in the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) as well as some basic primary health care services. The SRHR package includes ante-natal care, post-natal care, family planning, screening and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, clinical care for GBV survivors and referral for emergency and life-threatening cases. Clients will also be referred for anti-retroviral therapy (ART), long-acting reversible contraception, multi-sectoral GBV response services and more advanced MHPSS services, when appropriate. The project will also build the capacity of the health partners on MHPSS, GBV, MHPSS and inclusive service provision including a disability approach. Basic PHC services are also included in the package to ensure that those needs are met and also to encourage men, women, boys and girls to seek services that they may feel less inclined to seek if/when only SRHR services are available. 

The proposal includes the recruitment and training of male and female SRHR promoters from the covered camp and villages according to the guidance from state health department to improve community participation and sustainable mobilization. 

UNFPA will continue to support the SRHR Working Group in Kachin State to make sure that an effective coordination mechanism is in place for SRHR partners and contributes to adequate coordination around prevention and response to ensure timely delivery of SRHR services under the guidance of the Health Cluster with appropriate linkages to the Protection Sector, GBV Sub-Sector and Peer Support Network for MHPSS issues. The coordination body will also ensure the continuation of critical SRHR services even in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.</narrative>
