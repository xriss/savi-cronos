   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH Assistance for IDPs and Vulnerable Households in governorates Aden (Dar Saad district) and Amran (Harf Sufyan district) under Parameter 2</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with YHF&#x2019;s SA-1 and WASH cluster priorities and as per WASH cluster pre-allocated districts, CARE proposes a 12month project, with three months for approval of sub-agreements, in two districts Dar Sa&#x2019;ad (Aden) and Harf-Sufyan (Amran). The project will focus on increasing access to safe drinking water to targeted vulnerable communities. This will be through repairing and rehabilitation of 09 water schemes and systems (4  water systems in Aden - Dar Saad district: amp 5 schemes Amran &#x2013; Harf Sufyan district:). To ensure that the water supplied to targeted communities meets WASH Cluster/WHO standards water quality monitoring will be conducted. Water management committees (WMCs) will be formed or reactivated and each WMC will consist of 6 members of which 50% be female. These schemes and systems will be constructed or rehabilitated in areas where IDPs are located. 
To increase access to safe sanitation facilities and services, 80 emergency latrines will be constructed in Amran &#x2013; Harf Sufyan district. In the same district in Amran solid waste management activities will be conducted targeting IDPs locations. Desludging of stagnant water and cesspits will be conducted in Aden - Dar Saad district as well as cleaning up of blocked drainage channels or water ways. This is important in destroying habitants for disease causing organisms and therefore mitigate or reduce the spread of WASH related diseases.
 To improve Hygiene practices and knowledge among targeted communities, 100 (Aden - Dar Saad district:50 amp Amran &#x2013; Harf Sufyan district:50) community based hygiene promotion volunteers (CHVs) will be recruited, trained, equipped and used to conduct HP activities. For effective messaging CHVs will be equipped by printed IEC materials. In Amran CHVs will conduct cleaning campaigns and related activities in IDPs in hosting sites.
Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) and conducting baseline/endline will be integral parts of the design and implementation of this project. Considering heightened vulnerabilities of women and girls among the IDPs, the assistance will pay particular attention to their specific needs while finalizing distribution points, constructing latrines and hygiene promotion. Without double counting, the project cumulatively targets 39,800 direct beneficiaries, of which at least 70% are IDPs.
Limited assistance compared to higher number of IDPs in the targeted districts as well as vulnerability among the host communities can potentially pose operational risk. To mitigate this, CARE will strictly adhere to vulnerability based selection criteria to identify the most vulnerable for specific assistance such as latrines, hygiene kits etc. Likewise, the rehabilitation of water schemes will also serve host communities in need of water. In addition, COVID-19 situation can pose risk to the safety of staff, volunteers and beneficiaries but this will be mitigated by strictly adhering to the CARE&#x2019;s COVID-19 safety protocols outlined in its contingency plan. 
CARE has strong technical and operational capacity as well as access in the targeted areas. Led by competent national Area Managers, CARE is well established in the areas and have already discussed the project with relevant stakeholders which ensures their buy-in.</narrative>
