   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Implementation of Nationwide Polio outbreak response vaccination campaign to reach 800,000 children including 370,000 high-risk children 0-59 months of age.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported in Sudan during August 2020. Transmission of the virus is widespread, with 23 cases reported from 11 of Sudan&#x2019;s 18 states (as of 27 September 2020). The virus has also been isolated from nine sewage samples in Khartoum. The reemergence of polio in Sudan is a public health emergency of international concern as the presence of just one infected child places children across the country and those beyond Sudan&#x2019;s borders at incredible risk. The virus detected in Sudan is genetically linked to an outbreak in neighboring Chad and South Sudan, indicating cross-border spread. The countries are working together to synchronize activities to end the outbreaks.
in September 2020 ,Phase 1 of an Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) campaign was held in  four states - Khartoum, River Nile, Northern and White Nile. While a total of nine states were scheduled five states were unable to conduct IPV campaign due to the rainy season and flood emergency in Sudan. Raising routine immunization levels through vaccination with IPV is a critical part of closing the population immunity gap and providing lasting protection to children against polio. This year 109 low performing localities (13 states) completed a campaign for acceleration of Routine Immunization coverage in August.

WHO and UNICEF are working together with the Federal Ministry of Health and partners to support the Government&#x2019;s response to the outbreak to ensure every child under 5 years of age is vaccinated with oral polio vaccine. This is critical to reach the millions of children who have not received IPV.

The cVDPV2 outbreak response is to conduct at least two mOPV2 national rounds in order to offer children the best protection. Vaccinators will aim to provide polio drops to 8.6 million children under 5 across all 18 states of Sudan in October 2020, and again in November 2020. Protocols to protect against transmission of COVID-19  have been included into planning for the SIAs.

In October 2019, a polio outbreak simulation exercise was conducted to strengthen outbreak preparedness under the Sudanese National Polio Outbreak Preparedness and Response Plan, targeting state-level officers. This preparedness training enhanced the knowledge and capacity for outbreak response at the state-level and is contributing to stronger response planning. 

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic presented considerable challenges for protecting children from polio, particularly in high-risk populations. Travel restrictions in addition to the national fuel shortage affected the movement of people and samples, and the national polio laboratory in Khartoum was repurposed for analyzing COVID-19 tests. During this time, samples from AFP cases and the environment were retained in adequate conditions at a state level. Also,  the sub-National Immunization Day scheduled for March 2020 was paused and routine immunization activities were affected from early April 2020.  COVID related movement restrictions impacted case investigation and supervisory visits as well as due to the private sector slowdown. Since the end of July the Polio Lab was handed over to the Polio team and the surveillance strengthening activities were initiated in July 2020. Currently all surveillance indicators are in line with heightened standards as per the Polio Outbreak Response plans.</narrative>
