   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Start Fund Tropical Storm Chalane Mozambique</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On 30th December 2020, Severe Tropical Storm Chalane made landfall in Sofala Province, with strong winds of between 90 km/h and 130 km/h, accompanied by heavy rains of up to 100mm/24h. Chalane reached several districts in Sofala and Manica provinces, affecting over 9,200 families (more than 46,300 individuals), and resulting in the death of one individual and the injury of 13. Sofala and Manica Provinces were the worst affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai which impacted 1.8 million people in March 2019. As of November 2020, over 81,000 people who were displaced by Cyclone Idai were still living in resettlement sites. While attempting to recover from Idai and the impact of COVID-19 on their well-being and livelihoods, another shock in the form of Storm Chalane is testing the resilience of these populations. 
 While the impact of the storm was not as severe as predicted (initial predictions were that it would be a cyclone), its effect on individuals who are still reeling from multiple shocks should not be understated. According to IOM, the shelters of 4,938 families living in Cyclone Idai resettlement sites in Sofala and Manica were completely or partially destroyed by Storm Chalane. This means that these populations have to rebuild for the second time in less than two years. 
  
  The proposed Start Fund Project is aiming to respond to Shelter, WASH and food needs while mainstreaming protection concerns.</narrative>
