  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to support the most vulnerable IDPs with WASH services and winterization NFIs in Idleb camps by providing clean water, water tanks, hygiene kits, hygiene awareness, garbage containers and latrines as well as supporting the same targeted camps with heating fuel through restricted value E-vouchers.
Total beneficiaries is1622 HHs, 9622 individualls(2310 W, 2211 M, 2215 G, 2886 B) as following Camps:

Maaret Tmasreen (AlHamra:291,AlFesal,Al-Ajaj 214)
Dana (AlMadina 500,Huzefa bin Al-Yaman153,Brdghli 100)

Harim (AlMatar Road 80)
Salqeen (AlRefatyah100)
As targeted camps are already supported by Takaful till July, so, the continues of providing services is critical in saving individuals lives, un addition to benefiting from pre-provided supplies. 
The project will achieve its objectives through a combination of two main interventions:
WASH:
-In the first 3 months We will construct collection tanks in the camps and connect it with water sources by establishment a water supply network from the available sources to the high-water tanks in addition to linking it to the sub-tanks via a network within the camp ground for the following camps (bin Al-Yaman, Brdghli.Al-Matar, AlRefatyah) in order to increase sustainability and enviromental preservation, and during this period, we will provide water trucking 40 liter per person per day.
In (Al-Madina, Al-Hamra, Al-Fesal and Al-Ajaj) camps we will provide water trucking due to the inability to connect these camps to water sources for several reasons such as the large distances between camp and the source, necessity of the network passing through private lands or the camp location in high mountainous.
-To enhance the ability of the beneficiaries to hygiene, especially with condition of COVID19, we will distribute two hygiene kits for each family in the 2nd month and in 4th month and the contents will be according to cluster guidelines. Also, hygiene promotion sessions will be conducted in targeted camps, through trained mobile team (M,F) about the hygiene, COVID-19 preventions and IEC , taking into account the prevention procedures, social distancing and sterilization.
-Then we will work on construction of 244 latrines (122 blocks) according to cluster standards related to COVID-19, gender sensitive by building separated blocks, safe accessible, and its doors provided with locks, latrine for PwD with special arrangements, septic tanks will be desludging every 20 days.
During implementation of the project 203 garbage containers will be installed for the waste disposal once each two days for each camp will be implemented.

NFI:
At the beginning of winter, the same beneficiaries will be provided with restricted value E-voucher with total value of $180 which was determined to meet HH&apos;s winterization needs of 360 liter of fuel and a stove &quot;based on SNFI cluster guidance&quot; by dividing this value into three phases, where a specific balance ($60-$60-$60) will be loaded to HH&apos;s voucher at the beginning of each phase. 
1622 HHs will be targeted with various fuel types (Kerosene-Diesel&#x2013; Firewood and Olive pits) and stoves where this diversity will give the opportunities for HH to choose the type of fuel prefer and the related stove from the vendors who prefer, vendors will be selected according to specific criteria.
we will conduct a PDM to ensure that the service arrived to the beneficiaries in a smoothly and to measure beneficiaries satisfactory
In case of displacement during the implementation, priority will be given to newly IDPs, furthermore, if an urgent problem occurs and there is no possibility to distribute in one of targeted location, we will replace the beneficiaries and choose another beneficiary according to criteria in another location in coordination with SNFI Cluster
-Principles of Do No Harm will be applied in all activities through several market visits, distribution monitoring
We will coordinate with NGOs and the clusters to avoid any overlap.</narrative>
