   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing essential general protection and child protection services to conflict-affected girls, women, boys, and men in Idleb, Ariha and Jisr-Ash- Shugur</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syria Relief SR aims to continue providing General Protection and Child Protection services in south and west Idleb, after starting delivering those services in north Idleb under the 1st RA 2020. The project aims to deliver planned services to most vulnerable Girls, Boys, Women and Men GBWM in Idleb, Ariha and Jisr-Ash- Shugur districts through 4 static community centres CCs within 4 relatively densely populated communities in addition to 4 mobile units.
SR will ensure the services are accessible by PwDs and will consider all possible precautious measures (social distancing and using the PPE) and Cluster guidelines related to adapting Protection services delivery modalities in light with COVID-19, to ensure the safety of staff and beneficiaries and avoid causing harm (see attached SR COVID-19 Response Plan).

The services will be delivered during 12 months starting from 1st of Jul-20, addressing the identified Protection and CP needs of targeted individuals.
 The Overall Project Objective is designed to provide integrated protection and CP services and coordinate closely with local service providers from other sectoral services (FSL amp Early Recovery, WASH, and Health-Nutrition actors) to facilitate access of persons with specific needs to those services. 

The outcome of the proposed intervention will be conflict-affected and most vulnerable GBWM, including PwD, have a better understanding of their rights and better resilience through benefitting from legal Protection, Protection and Child Protection services.
 This Outcome has been informed by the ASOs 1 and 2 as outlined in the 2020 1st Standard Allocation. 
SR aims at the continuation of protection activities within areas of operation. Besides, the protection teams will extend their reach into new subdistricts in Idleb governorate rated 4, 5 or 6/ 6 in the severity scale. 
Protection services are intended to provide a package of essential preventive and responsive services to affected Host communities, IDPs and Returnees through expanding the capacity of mobile outreach teams, reactivating Ariha centre (CFS), and launching new Protection activities in parallel with the existing Education activities that SR implements in Jisr-Ash- Shugur. 
 The project is designed to reactivate Ariha static facility that SR evacuated in Oct-20 and add 1facility in Korin, 1 in Jisr-Ash-Shugur and the fourth facility in Hanbushiyeh. The 4 static facilities will be community hubs through which SR can identify and respond to most affected populations. 4 mobile units will be attached to those centres to reach out PwDs or those practising voluntary quarantine so they cannot visit the centres. The gender-mixed mobile units will also deliver the project services within 8 neighbouring communities.
The proposed CCs and mobile units will provide many general protection and child protection services including awareness-raising about legal protection, general protection and CP concerns. SR Teams will also provide case management and IPA to the identified most vulnerable GWBM. PSS will be delivered to girls and boys. Besides, parents will have the opportunity to join positive parenting skills sessions. Training about HLP/CSD and CP will be delivered to concerned humanitarian workers to ensure they are well capacitated. Community-based Protection committees will be supported. Furthermore, the Protection Teams will be part of the current Cluster taskforces and collect data related to Protection Monitoring and Child Protection Situational Monitoring surveys. Emergency focal points will be assigned to contribute to Cluster efforts in coordinating the Protection response. 
Protection services will provide a secure and supportive environment, building on existing capacities within the local communities and expanding the population of SR response team. SR Protection Teams will implement all Project activities directly with support from SR Turkey Office.</narrative>
