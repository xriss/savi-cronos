   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC as implementing entity of the IDA Private Sector Window (IDA PSW) Blended Finance Facility is expected to support working capital loans in PSW eligible countries under the WCS Facility with a first loss guarantee of up to US$216.1 million (blended concessional finance co-investment). Without the de-risking provided by IDA PSW, IFC will be limited in its ability to support Working Capital loans in IDA PSW countries given the increased demand for financing and the higher risk-return required in IDA PSW countries. This support is targeted in the context of responding and helping with the resilience measures around COVID-19 crisis.   &#xA0;  The level of concessionality provided to the WCS Facility by the blended concessional finance co-investment is estimated to be approximately 3% of the total PSW eligible facility size, which will be up to US$865 million. This estimate is based on the difference between (i) a reference price (either a market price if available; the price calculated using IFCs pricing model, which comprises three main elements: risk, cost and profit; or a negotiated price) and (ii) the concessional price being charged by the blended concessional finance co-investment.  In addition, IFC as an implementing entity of the Global SME Facility (GSMEF), the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility (WEOF) and/or the Women Entrepreneurship Finance Initiative (We-Fi) is expected to offer performance-based incentives (PBI) of up to US$2.4 million (in the aggregate for the WCS Facility) to support on-lending of the proposed working capital loans to women-owned and women-led enterprises. Without the GSMEF, WEOF and/or We-Fi support to incentivize on-lending to women entrepreneurs, IFCs FI clients COVID-19 response is unlikely to have any gender-focus at a time when the health and economic crisis posed by the pandemic is expected to disproportionately impact women. The estimated subsidy provided by GSMEF, WEOF and We-Fi assumes that the individual WCS loans supported by the PBI will fully reach the agreed impact and shall only be paid out upon achievement of the predefined gender carveout by each beneficiary FI. The level of concessionality (i.e., subsidy) provided by the PBI is estimated to be 0.22% of the assumed Gender Component of US$1.1 billion within the WCS Facility.  &#xA0;  Further details and historical information on estimated subsidy levels in IFCs blended finance portfolio can be found at: www.ifc.org/blendedfinance. As is the case with all of IFCs blended concessional finance co-investments, this project has been assessed against the Enhanced Blended Concessional Finance Principles for DFI Private Sector Operations adopted by IFC and more than 20 other DFIs in 2017. Further information on these Enhanced Principles and IFCs blended finance approach and governance can also be found at: www.ifc.org/blendedfinance. To support this increase in working capital needs at this most critical time, IFC is starting this support through existing clients.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The most significant expected project-level outcome is significant support for access to finance and liquidity for EM banks, traders, MSMEs, and other real sector borrowers. Beyond the project outcome, IFC anticipates that the WCS loans will support resilience during an acute crisis, also supporting an expeditious recovery once exogenous shocks have stabilized. The potential impact of the WCS loans is in no small part due to IFC&apos;s 15-year history in trade and short-term finance, including effective responses under WCS and other trade products in past crises.</narrative>
