   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In March 2014, a rapidly evolving outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever started in forested areas of south eastern Guinea. As of 25 March 2014, 86 suspected cases including 60 deaths had been reported in Gueckedou, Macenta and Kissidougou districts including four health care workers. Thirteen cases tested positive for Ebola virus, confirming the first Ebola haemorrhagic fever outbreak in Guinea. The epicentre of Gueckedou borders Liberia and Sierra Leone, where there are usually high numbers of people crossing open borders into these neighbouring countries. In March 2014, Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases were confirmed in Liberia, and then in May 2014 in Sierra Leone. EVD cases were confirmed in urban and rural areas of these three countries of intense transmission. Smaller numbers of EVD cases were confirmed in Mali, Nigeria and Senegal in August and September 2014 but these countries have all since been declared Ebola free by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Liberia was declared Ebola free in May 2015 but there were further cases in July 2015. In total there have been approximately 28,331 confirmed/probable cases and approximately 11,310 deaths worldwide &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; with the majority of these cases being in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Approximately 881 healthcare workers have contracted Ebola and 513 healthcare workers have died (information as of 23&#xC2;&#xA0;September 2015).</narrative>
