  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Niger is facing a current context of climate change in the Sahelian region. Its annual rainfall, between 100 and 800 mm, is characterized by significant interannual and spatial variability with consequent droughts and/or floods. These harsh climatic conditions affect agro-silvo-pastoral production and the socio-economic conditions of the populations. Floods are observed during the rainy period between June and September of almost every year.
Some of the factors that contribute to these floods are the following:
- pressure urban demographic growth: migration of the rural poor to the cities, fleeing the misery of their land.
- Uncontrolled occupation of areas potentially exposed to flood risks, 
- Failure of the city&apos;s sewerage network,
- changes in land use resulting in altered surface conditions and increased runoff, etc.

As of October 1, 549,049 people have been affected by the floods following the heavy rainfall recorded since July in the eight regions of the country, according to estimates by the Ministry of Humanitarian Action and Disaster Management. This exceeds the Flood Contingency Plan&apos;s forecast of 250,000 people likely to be affected by floods this year when heavy rainfall is expected, according to the national meteorological services.
To date, 69 people have died. The balance sheet also shows more than 39,000 houses damaged ; 67 classrooms, 36 mosques and one health facility have collapsed, more than 15,000 hectares of farmland destroyed  destroyed and more than more than 15,000 head of cattle killed.
This project therefore aims to provide food and non-food items to vulnerable households affected by these floods. Covid-19 fighting activities will also be implemented in the framework of this project to limit the spread of the virus between the affected populations.</narrative>
