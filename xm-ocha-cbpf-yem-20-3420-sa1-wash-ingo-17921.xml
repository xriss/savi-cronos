  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project proposes an appropriate and well-timed response to address immediate needs of extremely vulnerable IDPs and host communities in the Ad Dali District of the Ad Dhale&#x2019;e Governorate, in line with priority 2 of FSA 2020 allocation. Oxfam is well placed to implement this intervention based on existing organizational capacity and presence in Ad Dhale&#x2019;e. The project aims to provide humanitarian WASH assistance to 35,000 people (10,115 women, 10,290 men, 7175 girls, 7420 boys) by supporting their basic requirements for water, sanitation and hygiene practice. The proposed 12-month response will cover basic WASH needs through interventions that will improve access to water and sanitation, and promote safe hygiene practices. The response will adopt a community engagement approach to ensure the most vulnerable and marginalized IDPs and host communities in Ad Dali district receive adequate, dignified, inclusive and safe support to prevent and reduce morbidity and mortality due to WASH related diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic. Oxfam will upgrade and expand the existing barely functioning Ad Dali town water systems to improve the quantity and quantity of water, through developing and equipping an existing test borehole and expanding water supply pipelines, to deliver safe drinking water to 11 IDP camps. Oxfam will also ensure maintenance of existing pipelines and install an inline chlorine dozer to provide piped chlorinated water for both IDPs and host communities in the villages of Habeel, Al Sooq, Lakamt, Al Douki, Al Wa&#x2019;ara and Al Jalila in Ad Dali district, and Ad Dali town. The project aims at strengthening technical and operational support for the local LWSC and existing Water Management Committees in Ad Dali through skills training on water governance, operation and maintenance as well as supplying spare parts, water disinfecting agents, quality testing equipment, and three months fuel to power water pumping systems. To increase access to and use of safe and dignified gender-sensitive sanitation facilities, Oxfam will construct 50 shared household latrines and upgrade 50 existing latrines at IDP camps, including provision of latrine cleaning kits. Oxfam will also facilitate cleaning campaigns at target IDP camps including supply of environmental cleaning kits, with active participation of the target communities. Oxfam will implement successfully piloted approaches for community engagement, in hygiene promotion and behavioral change, and will share learning and good practice through the WASH cluster and technical working groups. Hygiene promotion in IDP camps and among the host community will be undertaken through 33 CHVs and community hygiene groups (CHGs) to tackle negative attitudes related to drinking chlorinated water and promote handwashing and safe and effective use of latrines. CHVs/ CHGs will be trained and equipped with communication tools, and hygiene promotion messages on identified public health risks, including Cholera/AWD and COVID-19, which will be delivered door to door at IDP camps to ensure reaching those with limited mobility. Oxfam Public Health Promotors (PHP) will also work with community leaders and CHGs to plan hygiene promotion and camp cleaning campaigns through community action planning. Prior to launching the project, Oxfam will conduct a thorough risk and threat assessment to ensure staff safety and project feasibility. Oxfam will use comprehensive SOPs for security management, activity-based SOP for COVID-19, duty of care SOP for staff safety, office working arrangement SOP for COVID-19 in place. Project activities will be implemented by Oxfam&#x2019;s WASH team based in Al Dali district, including National Public Health Engineer (PHE) and Public Health Promotion (PHP) Officers, good experience working in the area with both IDPs and host communities over the past four years. They will be supported by an international Team Leader (WASH) in Aden, and WASH Lead and PHP Advisor in Sana&#x2019;a.</narrative>
