       <narrative xml:lang="EN">2019 Target: - Review at least two of the following acts and policies; Parks and Wildlife Act; Wildlife Policy; and the development of Human Wildlife Conflict Policy, Communal Land Forest Produce Act and the Forest Act.

Workshops to identify gaps in the Parks and Wildlife Act, Forest Act and Communal Land Forest Produce Act were conducted. The following were identified as key gaps in the Parks and Wildlife Act: -o	There is no clear offence on possession of cyanide 
o	There is need to harmonize Acts. Absence of harmonized legislation (EMA, Forestry, Zimbabwe Parks) on hazardous substances
Gaps that exists in the forest legislations (Forest Act and Communal Land Forest Produce Act). The following were identified: -
o	The two pieces of legislation lack Sustainable Forest Management principles. 
o	Commercialization of forest produce should be included in the Act. Communities need to realize value of the forests for them to be effectively involved in the management of the forests.
o	Devolution in the management of the resource - communities should be actively involved in the management of the forests. Currently the state controls management of forests with little to no power by the communities, who are the resource users.
ZPWMA started consultation processes on wildlife policy. A number of key stakeholders in the wildlife sector were consulted.
Consultative Workshops for the development of the Human and Wildlife Conflict Policy were held with key stakeholders being consulted.

2019 Target: - Facilitate transboundary dialogue process between Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique and finalise drafting of the Lower Zambezi-Mana Pools TFCA MoU and ZIMOZA Agreement.

2019 Target: - Resuscitation of 40 Environmental Sub Committees (ESC), 3 Environmental Committees in Hurungwe, Mbire and Muzarabani Districts.
70 Environmental Sub-Committees (ESCs) in the three districts were resuscitated.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Outcome 1. Increased national capacity for IWT control, and integrated wildlife and woodland management

2020 Target: - Conclude at least 2 drafts of the following acts and policies; Parks and Wildlife Act; Wildlife Policy; and the development of Human Wildlife Conflict Policy, Communal Land Forest Produce Act and the Forest Act.

Although none of the policies have yet been completed, there has been significant progress in terms of preparatory procedures, consultations, reviews and initial analyses, as follows:
The process of reviewing wildlife related legislation and institutional frameworks was initiated by conducting nationwide consultations on the Wildlife Policy and the Parks and Wildlife Act. Issues of Human-Wildlife Conflict dominated most consultations. The country requires a Human-Wildlife Conflict Management Policy and this will be included in the Wildlife Policy. 

2020 Target: - Facilitate training of 75 key law enforcement agencies (ZPWMA, ZRP Minerals and Border Control Unit, FC, ZIMRA, EMA, investigators, judiciary, and prosecutors) with necessary trainings and tools to fight IWT and forest crimes.

The ZPWMA conducted two trainings for rangers, one on Basic First Aid and the other on management of human-wildlife Conflict Management. The Basic First Aid training was attended by 10 rangers (6 males and 4 females), whilst 25 rangers (2 females and 23 males) attended the human-wildlife conflict management training. The extended lockdown and increasing poverty levels due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted law enforcement in the Zambezi Valley during the reporting period. The number of arrests of poachers and other offenders for environment-related crimes increased during the reporting period, and these included underage offenders. The project responded by purchasing drones, boats and increasing rations and fuel for anti-poaching activities.

2020 Target: - Involvement of 1000 beneficiaries in awareness campaign targeting IWT, deforestation and climate adaptation/mitigation issues in the project areas.

The Environmental Management Agency held 32 awareness meetings on veld fire management legislation where 2000 participants attended during the 2020 fire season in the project.  In order to increase the awareness levels on dangers of veld fires, EMA also conducted 85 veld fire mobile awareness campaigns in Hurungwe, Mbire and Muzarabani District. The awareness campaigns reached out to at least 10,000 community members. The mobile awareness approach was employed as opposed to community gathering to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the project area. 14 kilometres fireguard was opened up in Muzarabani (8km) and Hurungwe (6km) districts in wards adjacent to the protected areas.
Due to the efforts that were made to prepare for the fire season, there was a reduction of area burnt by 4% compared to 2019 fire season in the project area. 

Outcome 2. Improved capacity of PA network and CAMPFIRE Wildlife Conservancies to protect globally significant biodiversity of the mid-lower Zambezi region over a total area of 1,616,900 ha

2020 Target: - At least 2 PA management plans are developed.

The process of hiring a consultant to develop the management plans took time. However, the project has provided funds to improve radio communication in the Zambezi Valley through enhanced communication among rangers. The ZPWMA signed a contract with PM Communications on 14 August 2020 for the supply and fixing of the radio equipment for upgrade of the Mid Zambezi Valley Radio System from analogue to digital. Full migration to the digital radio system is expected to be completed during the first third of 2021.

2020 Target: - Complete process of setting up of 3 CWCs in some districts.

The CAMPFIRE Association carried out consultations on the establishment of six Community Trusts in Mbire, Muzarabani and Hurungwe districts, and a total of 845 community members were consulted (645 men and 200 women). Community Trusts will operate in conformity with existing legislation in their interaction with government departments as well as the private sector.

OUTCOME 3 Increased area under sustainable management and increased benefits for local communities from CBWM, SFM and SLM in established CWCs

2020 Target: - Support the establishment of 3 nurseries and drilling of 14 boreholes in 3 CWCs.
78,616 seedlings were produced in 2020. The nursery at Mavhuradonha Wilderness commenced operation in the last third of the year with 14,634 seedlings being produced. Two nurseries have been fenced in the project area and boreholes will be drilled at the nurseries sites 
The Forestry Commission, ZPWMA and EMA carried out a joint operation to stop illegal charcoal production and firewood sales in Mbire and Muzarabani. 2058 bags of charcoal (packed in 50kg bags) and 13m3 of firewood were confiscated.

2020 Target: - Initiation of at least 6 livelihood enhancement activities through the Small Grants mechanism

The project facilitated the signing of small grant agreements between UNDP and five non-governmental organisations, namely Lower Guruve Development Association (LGDA), Southern Alliance for Indigenous Resources (SAFIRE), Environment Africa, Zim Apiculture Trust and Zambezi Society. To date US$194, 520.00 has been disbursed to support community projects under the small grants component of the project.

2020 TARGET: Project Board and Technical Committees meetings

Two board meetings were conducted in June and December 2020. The project conducted a technical committee in December to review 2020 progress as well discuss the 2020 annual report and 2021 annual work plan. The project steering/board met in December to discuss the 2020 Annual Progress Report and the 2021 Annual Workplan.</narrative>
