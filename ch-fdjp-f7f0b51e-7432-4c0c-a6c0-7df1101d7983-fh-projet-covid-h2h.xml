   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The fears expressed by the World Health Organisation of an &#x201C;infodemic&#x201D; &#x2013; false information that spreads like an epidemic &#x2013; accompanying the Covid-19 pandemic are coming true. Certain populations have been stigmatised and targeted, ineffective and dangerous remedies are being promoted, distrust in authorities and in preventive measures is mounting. Access to quality, reliable information is a basic necessity in this context. By providing reliable information, in real time and accessible to the greatest number of people, professional and trusted media facilitate the response of humanitarian actors and health professionals for the prevention of the pandemic, the provision of care, protection measures and the reconstruction of social links. Through fact-checking journalistic work, they help defuse rumours, combat misinformation and myths circulating among the population, and relay calls for calm. They provide information on gestures and attitudes, on the development of the general situation, access to care and the possibilities of movement. The media can also contribute to the reorganization of daily life, the provision of public services. They alert local authorities and accompany their initiatives and those of the international actors. They help to rebuild social ties, create dialogue in response to the risks of conflict generated by the pandemic, and play a role of &quot;companion&quot; in the face of feelings of isolation, and foster solidarity and trust. To respond to the situation described above, the Fondation Hirondelle launched a Global CVID-19 Project. This funding will allow us to add Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Uganda to this global program. This program is already underway and informing up to 65 million people through our Fondation Hirondelle-run media projects in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, RCA, DRC, Madagascar, and Myanmar. We are in negotiation with trusted partners in South Sudan and Cameroun to begin informing populations in those countries as well. A dedicated COVID19 editorial and operational team is actively supporting all of these operations. The following activities will be implemented : Production of vital information on the pandemic for a broad audience includes (1) daily or bi-weekly information relevant for in each country; (2) identify rumours and respond with confirmed facts, especially in digital media. This will include prevention messaging; (3) Local languages will be chosen for key messaging to reach the largest number of people, as well as specific vulnerable groups (such as refugees in Uganda). Distribution of information will be on existing networks including FM radio, social media, and possibly push SMS services, WhatsApp, and call-in telephone messages (VIAMO in Uganda). An 8- month programme from May to December is justified, with more capacity focused on the first critical 6 months, and 3 months focusing on recovery and stabilisation, and including research partners to better understand the role of communication and journalism during a pandemic. Observations will be shared for example in CERAH classrooms and with other partners including CDAC, TWB, The New Humanitarian etc.</narrative>
