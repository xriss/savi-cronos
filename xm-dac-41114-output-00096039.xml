       <narrative xml:lang="EN">GUINEA 


Social Protection:
In collaboration with the government of Guinea and other agencies, the UNDP promoted the creation of social capital by supporting community watch committees in Ebola affected communities.  These committees consist of village representatives, community workers, youth, religious leaders, teachers and survivors. They are charged with the responsibility of tracing contacts and identifying new Ebola infections and orphaned children . The mandates of the committees include &#x201C;promoting peace and dialogue and performing key functions such as safe burials and liaison between health workers and villages&#x201D; . As of May 2015, UNDP had trained and supported 128 community watch committees as part of the &#x2018;stop and treat&#x2019; agenda in Guinea. Furthermore, UNDP trained 550 young community leaders on preventive measures against Ebola .

Improved Payment System for Health Workers in Guinean:
The Payments Programme for Ebola Response Workers (PPERW) was developed to ensure payments were made on time with the right amount to the right worker to a growing number of Ebola Response Workers and financial workers in Guinea. UNDP currently pays 1,400 Ebola response workers working in the six Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in the country. UNDP also donated and installed autoclaves, using innovative technology to enable environmentally sound management of waste related to Ebola across the country. The country will benefit from these health facilities long after the outbreak has ended. 

Sanitation and Livelihoods:
In recognition of its impact on community health, the UNDP has intervened in the area of sanitation improvement and livelihoods, particularly in the urban communities in Guinea. The agency has helped in rebuilding infrastructures for sanitation and waste management in four urban districts of Gu&#xE9;ck&#xE9;dou, Macenta, Lola and N&#x2019;Z&#xE9;r&#xE9;kor&#xE9; in Guinea&#x2019;s forest region. This includes the construction of small bridges and latrine blocks in bus stations, which generates income for 1,549 youth (27 percent female).

Improving Economic Livelihood and Job Opportunities:
In Guinea, the UNDP helped the Government of Guinea (GoG) to develop a national strategy resulting in a Post-Ebola Priority Action Plan (PAPP) . This strategy is built around programmes and investment projects, and relevant support measures for recovery and resilience. At crosscutting level, the plan includes the restructuring and consolidation of state governance through a reformed public service. The total estimated cost of the PAPP over the 2015-2017 period will amount to US$2.5 billion and is broken down as follows: 63 per cent for health, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene for all; 4 per cent for governance, peace and social cohesion; 11 per cent for education, social and child protection, and basic services; 22 per cent for socio-economic recovery . 

The UNDP also intervened by assisting at-risk households and communities, as they recover from personal and economic losses. For instance, the agency provided 15 farmers organizations in Guinea (162 households) with 14 metric tonnes of fertilizer and 59 metric tonnes of seed for rice cultivation in the forest region . In the same vein, the UNDP has targeted job creation and livelihood improvement for thousands of Ebola-affected households in Guinea. Some of the interventions are outlined below: 

(i)	Livelihoods stabilization through innovative temporary employment programmes for 3,000 youth and women as well as recapitalization of 1,000 women&#x2019;s groups and social cash transfers to 8,000 households hit by Ebola; 
(ii)	Support to priority Ebola-hit economic value chains (among others, rice, potatoes, fruit) and to urban sanitation and waste management sectors, which will benefit up to 2,400 vulnerable youth and women; support to 40 community processing platforms and to vocational training schemes; 
(iii)	Together with UNCDF, financial education for all beneficiaries and use of adapted financial services leading to their financial inclusion; and 
(iv)	 Coordination of cash working group and Ebola recovery working group; support to capacity-building and policy development in the sectors of youth employment, sanitation and municipal solid waste management, and financial inclusion &#x2013; sectors playing a crucial role for resilience-building from Ebola .

Financial Mechanism for Ebola Recovery: 
The UNDP is also supporting the GoG to establish a dedicated financial mechanism to fund and manage the national Ebola recovery plans.  This mechanism will be responsible for coordinating the multiplicity of financial streams that were pledged for Ebola recovery . It is expected that the financial mechanism will provide coherence, transparency and accountability in Ebola recovery funding in Guinea. This strategy will among other things, reinforce the capacity of the GoG to &#x201C;identify the national mechanism&#x2019;s objectives and priority areas of interventions together with all stakeholders (i.e., line ministries, development partners, civil society and private sector)&#x201D; .

Despite economic setbacks caused by the EVD, the macroeconomic outlook is beginning to improve in Guinea. For instance, the agriculture sector recorded a growth of 5.5 percent in 2015 even though the overall economic growth rate was forecasted at only 0.4 percent.  However, growth in 2016 was to reach about 4.0 per cent .  

LIBERIA

Improved System of Payment for Health Workers:
As in other deeply affected countries, sickness and loss of life are the most visible effects of the EVD outbreak in Liberia. To help rebuild the social and economic structures of the society, UNDP projects in the country seek to address immediate EVD-related needs, which helps to re-establish the foundation of household, community and national resilience for future shock.  The UNDP assisted the Ministry of Health in Liberia in the payment of Ebola Response Workers (ERW) and payment of hazard pay to other routine health workers. The UNDP assisted in the payment of nearly 2,400 in in total, 50 percent of which were done in cash in the counties as only 50 percent of the workers had bank accounts . UNDP also paid about 539 other Ebola Response Workers that were not captured under the World Bank grant using MPTF funds, to the tune of 400,000 USD .  In collaboration with UNCDF, the UNDP has continued to provide technical assistance to microfinance institutions through the Micro-Lead program in Liberia. This is aimed towards the development of a competitive and sustainable inclusive microfinance sector in the country. 

Incident Management System (IMS):
 In support of the Government of Liberia in subsequent management of outbreaks and shocks, the UNDP has provided equipment to support the National Ebola Operations Command Centre (NECC) secretariat.  This is expected to strengthen oversight and co-ordination capacity of the IMS in the country . The NECC will provide oversight responsibility for managing the overall national strategy for the Ebola response. To reinforce its involvement in the system, the UNDP established a workstation within the centre. This will enable it to provide real time operational and technical assistance to the National Incidence Team, particularly at the community level response .

Livelihood/Economic Recovery:
Due to the EVD outbreak, the sale of bushmeat was suspended in Liberia as a precautionary measure. The implication is that hunters and bushmeat sellers in the country lost their means of livelihood. To help cushion the economic effect of the suspension, the UNDP initiated a small project of one-time assistance to 400 bushmeat sellers across six markets in urban and peri-urban Monrovia. The goal is to assist households that relied on the hunting and trading of bushmeat to shift to other income-generating enterprises.  The agency also provides and labour-constrained households with monthly safety net cash transfers, which will enable them to improve their livelihoods. 

In support of agricultural production in post-Ebola Liberia, and in line with the Kokoyah Millennium Villages Development Project in the country, the UNDP provided 6.5 metric tons of fertilizer and 1,207 pieces of simple farming tools to 11 farming groups and 638 household farmers in 17 towns . Over 353 persons have been trained in every aspect of agriculture science to expand service to the sector . These interventions have contributed to increase rice and cassava production, which were adversely affected by Ebola outbreak. As the EVD outbreak gets under control in Liberia, and in collaboration with the Ministry of Gender and Development, UNDP began the identification of 3000 households in Bong County that are expected to benefit from the Social Cash Transfer programme . Under the programme, people living in extreme poverty, as well as those whose sources of income have been hit as a result of the Ebola crisis, will be given a monthly stipend. Based on the livelihood initiatives and other economic recovery programmes underway, the economic growth in Liberia was projected to increase to 3.9 percent in 2016 .

The UNDP also supports livelihood training for youth as part of the Ebola recovery efforts in Liberia. In partnership with the Center Songhai Liberia (CSL), UNDP has concluded plans to launch a 4-months Youth-Focused Vocation/Skills Training targeting mainly young people .  The training is expected to provide a range of skills covering areas such as general agriculture; pastry, catering services, garri and soap making; repair works (electronics); value chain; entrepreneurship development skills; and first aid, amongst others. The training program will provide the youth population with soft-skills including the principles of social cohesion, empowerment and gender equality. About 200 youths will benefit from this training.

Governance, National Security and Peace Keeping:
To ensure peace stability and security, the UNDP also lunched the Enhanced Border Surveillance Project in Liberia. This is expected to enhance the logistical capacity of the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization (BIN) and the Liberian National Police (LNP).  The provision of 16 vehicles, 70 motorcycles coupled with other relevant resources to the LNP and BIN is an effort to enhance border control and surveillance, especially in the border counties Bong, Nimba and Lofa. 

Women Empowerment:
To support the livelihood of women in post-Ebola Liberia, the UNDP in collaboration with the Angie Brooks International Center for Women&#x2019;s Empowerment (ABIC) donated 11 motorbikes to the female motorcyclist&#x2019;s association, &#x201C;Pink Panthers Motorcyclists&#x201D; of the Montserrado County .  It is expected that the motorbikes will help to improve and rebuild the career of female motorcyclists in small business ventures. 


SIERRA LEONE

Improved Economic Livelihood and Social Protection:  
The UNDP has equally supported the government of Sierra Leone in developing its National Ebola Recovery Strategy. The recovery strategy is planned for implementation within a period of 24 months, spanning July 2015 to June 2017 .  The first six to nine months will focus on restoring basic access to healthcare, getting children back to school, social protection and restoring growth through the private sector and agriculture.

As part of the recovery efforts in Sierra Leone, UNDP currently supports 1,050 Ebola survivors and destitute families to recover their basic livelihoods through the distribution of discharge packages and social cash transfers . This assistance is delivered through the Ebola Payment Platform developed by UNDP for the payment of Ebola response workers through mobile money. Working with the Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic Corporation, the UNDP delivered solar lanterns to communities of Persons with Disabilities, and others affected by the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone . Given the acute shortage of stable supply of electricity, the solar lamps helped these communities maintain normal life styles.  

To promote financial inclusion in post-Ebola era, the UNDP in collaboration with the Central Bank of Sierra Leone and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), launched Sierra Leone&#x2019;s first mobile money regulations. This aimed at accelerating the delivery of financial services to the poor, including women and youth . This is the first step towards encouraging people to adopt electronic channels of payments ad move away from the traditional cash-based economic system.

The Government of Japan through UNDP, funds a Livelihoods and Security Sector Reform project (Community Policing) to be implemented in both Kambia and Kailahun District. These projects are intended to provide support to the Government of Sierra Leone in response to the EVD through the provision of cash transfers and emergency employment creation schemes. This project will support targeted individuals, and households in prioritised communities to meet their immediate needs and recovery. In addition, it will also strengthen and facilitate the growth and diversification of Small and Medium Enterprise&#x2019;s (SME&#x2019;s), which will spur inclusive economic recovery and increase opportunities for paid employment . Programming will support both on-going efforts as well as new initiatives in two key areas: the Security Sector and livelihoods .

Improved Cross-border Security and Surveillance: 
In support of security screening and cross border surveillance, the UNDP funds community policing projects in the border district of Kambia in Sierra Leone .  This district shares a long international boundary with Guinea, and there is a deep socio-cultural and economic ties between the two countries. Community policing, which is currently being implemented in 3 chiefdoms within Kambia District also has as its key objectives of rebuilding community confidence in in the Police force. This will promote crime reporting and reduction.
 
Sierra Leone Ebola Recovery Fund (SLERF):
The UNDP has assisted in the establishment of the Sierra Leone Ebola Recovery Fund (SLERF). The SLERF will play an important role in the transition from response to recovery efforts and in the implementation of the National Ebola Recovery Strategy (NERS) . The SLERF is modeled after the International UN Ebola Conference that was held in July 2015. UNDP&#x2019;s Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office (MPTF-O), which is appointed trustee of the fund, will perform its fiduciary role in accordance with the highest international standards. This will ensure excellence and full transparency in receipt and administration of contributions, transfer of funding to approved projects and periodic reporting and monitoring highlighting achievements. 

Social Rehabilitation and EVD Survivors Project:
The UNDP has embarked on the Social Rehabilitation and Payments to EVD Survivors and affected families in 4 local councils in Sierra Leone. In addition, the project provides psychosocial, hygiene and sanitation support for EVD survivors and destitute families . However, and as of October 2015, the project activities are yet to start in full due to the lack of a verifiable list of survivors. The project seeks to support sustainable livelihoods for EVD survivors and women rendered destitute by the effects of the Ebola crisis . The project seeks to increase household incomes and food security through sustainable livelihood interventions. However, improving the entrepreneurial skills and capacity of beneficiaries is central to the project&#x2019;s aims and strategy. Women survivors and widows face increased challenges to meeting basic needs and achieving wellbeing for themselves and their families. It is expected that the project will socially protect the beneficiaries and build resilience. In addition, it will address vulnerabilities and social marginalization among Ebola survivor families. Under this programme, nearly 3000 survivors have undergone ophthalmic examination with some 350 confirmed as having uveitis, an inflammatory condition that destroys eye tissues.  The local councils that benefitted from the project are Bo, Kailahun, Kenema, Moyamba, Bombali, and Port-Loko .</narrative>
