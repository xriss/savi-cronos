   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COVID-19 pandemic and the desert locust upsurge erode food security and livelihood assets of vulnerable communities in the country. Since the first report of the COVID-19 case in March 2020, mitigation measures taken to slow or stop the spreading of the virus. However, the COVID-19 mitigation measures include movement and transportation restrictions that have socio-economic effects that exacerbate the vulnerability of crises affected people and are putting extra pressure on the already growing needs for humanitarian assistance. According to the revised HRP in August 2020, humanitarian needs increased to 16 million people, exacerbated by the multi-sector impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately impacts crisis-affected communities and increased the multiple needs of them. Of which 1.8 million of them are IDPs / recent returnees, of which the majority (1.2 million) due to conflict and 0.6 million due to climate - with drought affecting about 0.4 million and about 0.2 million affected by floods (IOM, July 2020 DTM). Similarly, in East Harrghe 29,000 IDPs are not returned to their original places, and in West Hararghe 55,674 IDPs are still living either in temporary IDP camps or in regular IDP settlement areas found in Miesso, Doba, and Gumbi Bordede Woredas. To respond to the current emergency, the two partners, CARE, and ANE (local NGO) established a consortium to respond in the three woredas of East and West Hararghe and Borena zones. ANE will implement the Shelter repairing activities in Guchi Woredas(for 200HH)  of the Borena zone, and CARE will provide ESNFI support for 1870 IDPs in Kumbi, and GubiBorded Woredas of East and West Hararghe zones, respectively.  During the implementation of this project, the partners will follow similar approaches and methodologies in terms of beneficiaries targeting, registration and verification process, and applying of complaint response mechanism. The two partners will work in a very coordinated and collaborative way to appropriately and effectively respond to the crises, and, if there is any capacity gap in terms of project implementation, CARE will provide capacity building training to ANE staff.  
Hence, ANE will facilitate discussion with local government to ensure Housing and Land Property (HLP) rights of shelter repairing beneficiaries in Guchi woredas. During beneficiary targeting the most vulnerable community group including child-headed household, a separated child, Children at risk, female-headed household, elders, and people with underlying chronic illness, a large family with more dependence with no alternative livelihoods will get the priority. Therefore, in-kind shelter repairing kits, and ESNFI assistance will be delivered to the target beneficiaries. The project will follow up COVID-19 specific beneficiary&#x2019;s targeting, registration, and distribution operation procedure. Post-distribution monitoring assessment will be conducted using shelter cluster standard tools. To minimize the duplication of effort at the woreda level, the consortium will coordinate with different stakeholders who are working at the project implementation woredas. Besides, to support the country&#x2019;s effort to mitigate the spread and reduce the damage of the COVID-19 pandemic, CARE is proposing a sensitization and community awareness-raising campaign in Kumbi and Gumbi Boreded woredas. To reduce the risks of protection and GBV for the beneficiaries during targeting, registration, and assistance delivery, CARE will provide PSEA and GBV training to the government&#x2019;s staff and targeting committees.  Besides, the consortium organizations will have a regular monthly meeting that will focus on project progress update, humanitarian and other situation updates, and operational challenges issues and concerns. Finally, ANE will submit the final  narrative report to CARE. CARE will also compile it and submit to EHF. To undertake the above-mentioned activities, a total of 434,375 USD is proposed.</narrative>
