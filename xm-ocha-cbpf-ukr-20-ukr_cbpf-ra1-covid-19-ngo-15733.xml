contact line due to COVID-19</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our project is aimed at providing Enhancement of home-delivered assistance in isolated settlements along the contact line due to COVID-19. The project includes comprehensive assistance to elderly people living alone, the most vulnerable elderly people and people with disabilities in isolated settlements along the contact line in Government Controlled Areas of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts. Within the framework of the project, we will carry out the following activities:
- 30 additional social workers from among local residents in isolated settlements along the &#x201C;contact line&#x201D; will provide home-based care to some 1000 elderly people living alone, the most vulnerable elderly people and people with disabilities, visiting each of them at least 1-2 times per week. The assistance will also include provision of food, hygiene kits and based on the need, social workers will also replenish the supply of medicines for older people from the nearest pharmacies, according to the prescription for the beneficiary&apos;s funds, ensuring the delivery of medicines to older people at home.

- 4500 food sets will be delivered to the home of elderly people and people with disabilities living in isolated settlements along the contact line
- 3000 hygiene kits will be provided to 3000 families of elderly people and persons with disabilities (about 4500 persons) in the isolated settlements along the contact line

- 15000 residents of isolated communities will be informed on COVID-19
- 75 electric bicycles (40 of which at the expense of this project and 35 under UNHCR funding) will be purchased by Proliska for social workers, community leaders, postmen and local paramedics in order to increase their mobility in terms of providing the home-based care for the elderly and providing them with food, hygiene kits and medical services at home.
The target group of the project are elderly people in need of home-based care, including provision of services, food and hygiene during quarantine.

Currently, the organization has more than 130 employees who are the members of the communities along the &#x2018;contact line&#x2019;. Thanks to this, we have a positive reputation in the communities and access to all the settlements with limited access where we carry out activities.
