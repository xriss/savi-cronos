   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support formal and non-formal education in North West Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to support formal and non-formal education for 13888 dropped-out children (boys &#x2013; girls)or who are at risk of dropping out of school (aged 5-17, 6110 B and 7778 G, 9792 IDPs and 4096 HCs) through supporting 13 schools which their fund will be ended during June and July 2020. The project also works on expanding schools&apos; capacity so that they are able to receive more displaced children and to reduce classroom crowding as a response to Covid-19 pandemic, where those schools are located in concentration points for IDPs in Dana, Idleb and A&apos;zaz communities.
-During summer (July and Aug), compensatory and supplementary lessons will be provided from the adopted government curriculum to assist 4554 children (1621 B, 2933 G) in Dana and Idleb to get back to the level of their grades after such challenging period of studying, in addition to providing PSS sessions to help children (boys &#x2013; girls) to overcome the challenges and circumstances they passed during last months.

-During 20-21 academic year, formal and non-formal education will be provided in targeted 13 schools as follow:
Provision of two cycle non-formal education through catch-up and remedial classes for 1950 out of schools&#x2019; children (boys &#x2013; girls) and low-leveled students using curriculum B, cycle&apos;s duration is 4 months. Students who pass ASER test will be given a certificate of completion so that they can continue their learning process as formal students

-Supporting formal education for 11938 children (5135 B, 6803 G) by providing operational costs, learning and teaching materials, schools&#x2019; supplies, and heating materials, in addition to providing weekly PSS sessions to overcome the harsh experience of war conditions and to motivate them continuing their studies at schools.
-In order to increase access to children to the targeted schools, project will work on increasing schools&apos; absorption capacities by conducting light rehabilitation for damaged/unused classrooms based on accurate need assessment, in addition to providing TLSs to decrease overcrowding and facilitate social distancing and to receive new students.
-To ensure safe and easy access for CwD (boys and girls), Takaful will provide schools with tools and equipment for CwD such ramps, Iron stair handrails, special toilet, not connected desks and chairs with height adjustable function in addition to providing transportation for CwD, taking into account that Takaful was distributed 9 out of 13 targeted schools with these tools in previous projects.
-Takaful will work to conduct awareness sessions to minimize the spread of Corona Virus for all staffs and students, together with sterilizing all schools before students get in.
-The project will provide 288 teachers and education personnel (173 M/115 F) with incentives in Dana and Idleb schools, as A&apos;zaz schools already receive teachers&apos; incentives from other party.
-To ensure best community engagement, meetings will be held with local actors (males and females) of the targeted locations in order to describe project&apos;s goal and hear their recommendation and collect detailed 
information about the specific locations of dropping out children and the reasons of their dropping out and their needs.
-Plan B:  
* In case of continued schools&apos; suspension due to the Corona pandemic, Takaful will go to distance learning methods (as it&apos;s currently used) by setting up WhatsApp groups that include all classroom&apos;s students together with teachers and followed up by educational personnel in the school, where lessons are given through audio and video clips which are published on groups. Students&apos; questions are received through those groups and they are answer at the same time. 
* if we weren&apos;t able to reach some schools or they received support from another NGO, by selecting schools with the same criteria in the target districts or other sub-districts, where we have full access.</narrative>
