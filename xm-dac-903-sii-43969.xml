   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stakeholders impact: The Project will provide the financing required to support the tourism-related businesses, including those SMEs in the tourism value chain, with their working capital requirements, and to expedite their post crisis recovery. The Bank has designed a working capital financing program to support the sector in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, and the Project will extend the Banks&apos;s effort to this critical sector, which would, in turn, have a positive cascade to related value chains.

Market Impact: BML is the largest bank in Maldives and has significant presence across the economy, reaching the majority of private sector in the critical tourism sector. By supporting the largest financial institution for the private sector, the Project is supporting market resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project consists of a senior secured loan of up to US$50 million and a potential mobilization of up to US$50 million to Bank of Maldives (BML or the Bank), a state-owned bank in the Maldives (Project). The proposed investment will be in the form of a USD senior secured loan to BML with a tenor of up to 3 years. The investment is in response to the crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID - 19) global pandemic which has adversely impacted the tourism industry, resulting in a liquidity crunch in related sectors. The proposed IFC funding will be on-lent by the Bank through working capital loans to support companies and SMEs in the tourism and services sectors in the Maldives, which have been impacted due to COVID-19.</narrative>
