  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Ethiopia is facing an unprecedented crisis due to the Covid-19 (C19) pandemic, compounded by a devastating desert locust invasion, widespread flooding and rising food prices. C19 is having an indirect and drastic impact on the food security situation throughout the country. A multisectoral assessment conducted in the Somali region shows that 75% of HHs have reduced their food consumption (Mercy Corps). Recent political unrest has caused many new internal displacements, resulting in overcrowded urban areas and informal settlements, which lack sufficient WASH infrastructure. Essential primary healthcare services have been reduced or suspended, meaning fewer mothers, women, girls and children &lt; 5 can access routine treatment and/or other health services, including MHPSS. Women are especially vulnerable, often depending on the informal economy and lacking personal resources to cope with price increases. Access to healthcare is under threat due to fear of infection, increased caseload, lack of PPE and low staff capacity and training. Protection needs continue to rise, as cases of domestic abuse and SGBV have increased. 


SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages Ethiopia (SOS CVE) together with  local partner OWDA will provide FSL, WASH and Health in Gode town, Kelafo, and Adadle woredas in the Shebele Zone -areas with high food insecurity (IPC3), where social and health services are mainly closed, and few other humanitarian actors are present. The intervention will focus on the provision of food via vouchers, hygiene promotion and awareness, critical WASH activities and primary health care services. The intervention will provide MHPSS (including treatment for SGBV victims) and improve the protection environment especially for children and women by mainstreaming protection across all activities. Coordinating with DRA members Oxfam, Plan and Dorcas, working in other zones of the Somali region, SOS CVE will offer health care referral services in order to maximise programme impact.
