  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CARITAS Hwange is one of the dioc&#xE8;ses that participated in the Emergency Appeal Drought Response Project [CIEA02/2020] which ran from January through to December 2020. The selection of Hwange district to participate in the project was informed by findings from the 2019 Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZimVAC) Rural Livelihoods Assessment and the CARITAS Zimbabwe National Rapid Food Security Assessment (October 2019). The 2 assessments confirmed Hwange&#x2019; s vulnerability status. 
Hwange district experienced long dry spells in December 2019 and January 2020, which was coupled with the early cessation of the rain season. This affected the crop production for the district. Household income and purchasing power had been further eroded by the poor macro-economic situation. Mid-season drought experienced in January to February 2020 resulted in more than 45% right off cereal crops especially maize (Agritex First Round crop Sample Survey report 2020). This resulted in reduction of low area planted. 
The advent of COVID-19, which led to the national lockdown from April 2020, exacerbated the situation for the rural communities in Hwange district. COVID-19 created a severe economic shock, mostly in the form of loss of income, particularly for the most vulnerable who depended on agriculture and remittances from relatives within and outside the country. 
 
CARITAS Hwange started distributing food to selected households in Nemananga ward under the EA Drought response project in April 2020 up to August 2020. The distribution ended prematurely due to shortage of funds since the appeal was not fully funded, resulting in communities slipping back to food crisis. Nemananga ward is one of the wards near the Victoria Falls. The ward experienced an influx of people who relocated from Victoria Falls as a result of lock down induced retrenchments, especially those under the tourism sector. The targeted area therefore remains food insecure and in need of assistance.</narrative>
