   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the food security status of assessed food insecure people by providing cash for food and response to winterization needs by providing cash for heating.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is complementary to other SCHF ongoing project (14980), that aimed to provide one-off MPGs to 4375 families to the newly IDPs and most vulnerable HCs in the north of Aleppo, the distribution of MPGs will be finalized by the end of June, and this project will complement what we have started before, the project consists of two main activities in two sectors:
1- Under FSL: GAN will shift the beneficiaries from the emergency to a regular assistance to the most vulnerable families (1000 out of 4375) in two communities: Mar&#x2019;e and Salamah, the geographical areas are prioritized by FSL, GAN conducted 1751 interviews between 8 April to 20 May, 96% of families were unable to secure food according to the answers of the heads of families.
The proposed modality is a cash for food, as it is considered the most effective especially under the context of COVID-19 epidemic, where cash modality requires less staff during the delivery of assistance and reduces touching with the beneficiaries, according to our experience in this modality the beneficiary does not need more than 5 minutes to receive the assistance.
The assistance will be tailored according to the family size to achieve the benefit and the fair distribution of the assistance (12$ per person monthly) as the sector strongly recommended the feeding period of 8 distributions (8 months out of 12 months) to the assessed same food-insecure households.
a monthly market assessment in terms of availability of the items, prices, and accessibility will be conducted to ensure the local markets are functioning and all beneficiaries have a good and equal accessibility to the different goods.
GAN selected the beneficiaries in the ongoing project (14980) with 100% verification based on the vulnerability and eligibility criteria including displacement duration criteria since the newly IDPs are the most vulnerable groups to the shocks, the project also prioritized the women-headed households as well as the households with children, disabilities, pregnant, and lactating women, so GAN will re-visit 100% of beneficiaries to identify the most people in need to target them. 
2- Under SNFI: GAN will respond to life-saving winterization needs for the same beneficiary: according to the 1751 interviewed families About 26% of them live in tents, 37% of them live in unfinished homes or not suitable for living (cellar, warehouse, hangar) and the bad conditions of these families lead to more challenges for them, especially during the winter season as these families use multiple means of heating according to their financial ability, and based on the last PDM results and lesson learned, one type of heating fuel did not achieve the expected benefit, families that live in tents prefer use firewood and/or perrin for heating others prefer diesel, and the targeted areas where (-4) is the lowest registered degree with some coverage of snow in different locations and (4) the average degree in winter, all of these conditions drive families to adopt many negative coping mechanisms, so GAN conclude to provide winterization heating means using e-voucher modality to access all type, the distribution will be conducted in 3 monthly rounds, starting from 1 Nov 2020 to Jan 2021, 2 weeks for redemption and 2 weeks for validation and PDM, 60$ per family will be assigned monthly, 180$ in total during the intervention period, this will enable families to purchase their preferred type of heating means.
Due to the lack of the banking system in northern Syria, GAN will identify the money transfer agents by conducting a competitive process after assessing the markets and the vendors&apos; capacities in the local markets. where the identified vendors will be responsible for delivering the cash amount to the beneficiaries in the different locations and the payment for agent will be conducted after finalizing the distribution of each few days which reduces the security risk in delivering the cash in such complex context.</narrative>
