   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Project was approved in the context of the Bank&apos;s response to the COVID-19  pandemic.  To avoid delays to the delivery of this project, the Bank&apos;s  President granted a deviation from the ordinary timelines for PSD disclosure,  as contemplated by Section V of the Directive on Access to Information.   Details of the Bank&apos;s response to COVID-19, and this deviation, can be found on  our website.  Project Description:  MSME senior unsecured credit line of up to USD 100 million in favour of JSC  Bank of Georgia. The Project will go under the Financial Intermediaries  Framework (BDS 15-50) and will be complementary to the EBRD COVID-19 crisis  response in Georgia, helping to address challenges outlined in the Solidarity  Package (BDS20-039).     Project Objectives:  The Project will enable Bank of Georgia to maintain uninterrupted lending to  MSMEs severely affected by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.     Transition Impact:  ETI score: 60  The project contributes to the objectives of the Financial Intermediary  Framework, supporting Competitive and Resilient transition qualities. With its  wide regional outreach, BOG is well positioned to provide finance to MSMEs and  attract new MSME clients. BoG will ensure sound banking principles and will  support local currency lending.     Additionality:  EBRD&apos;s participation in the proposed transaction is expected to be highly  additional in light of severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Georgian  economy and MSME sector in particular, greatly elevated risk aversion by  commercial lenders and confidence-enhancing effect of EBRD&apos;s financial backing.     Environmental and Social Summary:  Categorised FI (ESP 2019).  Bank of Georgia (BoG) is well known to the Bank  through a number of transactions, over a number of years.  BoG has a  well-developed suite of policies and procedures for the management of key  issues under PRs 2, 4 and 9. BoG will be required to continue compliance with  PRs 2, 4 and 9 and to provide the EBRD with annual E&amp;amp;amp;S reports.     Implementation Summary (only complete if and when an OPA is completed): not  applicable     Technical Cooperation: None</narrative>
