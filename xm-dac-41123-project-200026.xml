   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Response Assistance to the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and continued to expand to other cities in the country. It has a significant impact on people&#x2019;s lives, health, and overall socioeconomic development of the country. On 30 January 2020, the WHO Director-General announced the outbreak of COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Strong international cooperation will be essential at all levels to protect the people and build a safe and healthy future for all.

In order to combat the COVID-19 and win the battle of prevention and control of the contagion, the Chinese government has taken many measures. The demand for medical waste disposal capacity has increased significantly and the emergency disposal capacity of medical wastes in epidemic areas is in urgent need. At the same time, staff dealing with medical waste in hospitals and medical wastes disposal are facing a serious risk of infection, resulting in a shortage of personal protective equipment in the short term. Wuhan and its home province of Hubei are the worst affected regions, calling urgently for assistance from the outside world due to the serious deficiencies in the emergency disposal capacity of medical wastes and personal hygiene protection.

The project was initiated following a request for emergency assistance from the Foreign Environmental Cooperation Centre, Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China (FECO/MEE) regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. UNIDO responded immediately to the request. An understanding on the project objectives, scope, cost estimates and implementation arrangements were reached between UNIDO and FECO/MEE through a tele-conference on February 5, 2020.

This project is designed as an emergency response assistance project to support Hubei province in environmentally sound management of medical wastes, and eventually avoiding the spread of COVID-19.</narrative>
