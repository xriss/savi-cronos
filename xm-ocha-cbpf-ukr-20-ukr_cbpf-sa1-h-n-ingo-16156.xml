   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing capacity of the healthcare system to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic emergency in Eastern Ukraine (Luhansk NGCA)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unlike the rest of the government controlled Ukrainian territory, the eastern part of the country, including the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, is the most vulnerable area due to the protracted military conflict that has negatively influenced the local infrastructure of mainly rural settlements. The poor state of economy, transportation networks and proximity to the militarized area played a key role in the deterioration of the general regional situation (HRP2020). The first case of COVID-19 in Ukraine was confirmed on February 29, 2020 and was classified as having been imported from abroad. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of May 13, 2020, there are 16 425 cases officially confirmed out of 41 327 suspected cases, which has resulted in 439 deaths.  

As of 11th May, there were 416 reported cases in the NGCA, 232 in LNGCA (Humanitarian Impact of COVID-19. OCHA SitRep No3). After several years of conflict, the healthcare system in the NGCA has experienced severe deterioration mainly due to the cut of medical supply from the GCA, causing shortages of drugs, medical supplies and equipment and a lack of healthcare workers. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide and the first COVID-19 infected patients in Ukraine, a general demand for personal protective equipment increased dramatically in the region. This has led to an acute shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), medicines, disinfectants and medical equipment in Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which has caused an increasing risk of infection contamination, as well as limited diagnostic, treatment and patient servicing capacities. Transportation of humanitarian aid from GCA to NGCA is restricted to medical, hygiene, food or COVID-related items, and suspended between DNGCA and LNGCA. Recently, the GoU and LNGCA authorities have allowed the delivery of assistance through EECP &#x2018;Stanytsia Luhanska&#x2019;. 

The objective of the present intervention is to reduce morbidity and mortality by supporting the response efforts against COVID-19 by applying preventive measures and supporting the curative preparedness, strengthening of the healthcare system in Luhansk NGCA by providing life-saving medical equipment and priority medical supplies to 7 COVID-19 designated hospitals. Activities will focus mainly on provision of life-saving medical equipment and commodities to strengthen capacity of intensive care units to be able provide quality emergency services and address respiratory complications. Besides, the PPE, specific commodities and hygiene utilities will be provided to those hospitals in order to increase efficiency of Infection control measures in the isolation wards and in the entire hospital.</narrative>
