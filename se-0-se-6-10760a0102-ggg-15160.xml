OHCHR has applied to Sida for funding of SEK 40 000 000 to carry out and expand the Emergency Response Teams and Contingency Fund to respond to the global COVID-19 pandemic during the period 2020-2022. 

The interventions aim at expanding and strengthening the field presence of OHCHR to assure human rights are incorporated in regional and national programmes inlcuding COVID-response programmes by deploying expertise to build capacity within the field offices. 

The programmes&apos; total budget is USD 13 201 784, out of which Sida contributes with SEK 40 000 000. The support will be divided between both programmes, where SEK 35 500 000 will be directed to the ERTs and SEK 4 500 000 to the Contingency Fund.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Regional Emergency Response - COVID-19 and human rights
The intervention seeks to strengthen OHCHR&#x2019;s capacity to prevent and respond to serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including in the context of COVID-19; and at the same time, support the wider United Nations effort to become more effective in anticipating, preventing and responding to crisis and conflict.
Two outcomes are presented for the intervention:
i) decision-makers at the global, national and regional level take preventive measures and early action to address serious violations of international human rights&#xA0;and humanitarian law, including negative socio-economic and other human rights impacts of COVID-19 response and recovery measures, with a focus on vulnerable populations:
ii) Enhanced access to early warning analysis of the human rights situation by national partners&#xA0;in impacted regions
To deliver on this commitment, OHCHR will improve how it identifies, manages, analyses and leverages human rights information to support strategic and operational decisions. This is accomplished by putting human rights officers and information management professionals in the field &#x2013; the Emergency Response Teams &#x2013; to support operations and engage with information channels in humanitarian and development as well as human rights contexts.
Targeting resources to support field presences is expected to lead to more actionable data and information, with OHCHR better able to identify emerging risks and promising practices; and provide the situational awareness required to inform the timely, evidence-based, strategic and operational decisions made by the United Nations System and Member States.&#xA0;
Contingency Fund
The intervention seeks&#xA0;to strengthen&#xA0;OHCHR&#x2019;s capacity to respond to human rights deteriorating situations currently arising from pandemic and to ensure that a Human Rights-Based Approach is integrated in all UN responses at the global, regional and country levels.
In the context of the ongoing OHCHR&#x2019;s COVID-19 response, the Contingency Fund would be used to enable the deployment of a temporary surge capacity (local recruitment/deployment of a temporary Human Rights Officer) in an OHCHR field presence (in person and/or remotely, as travel restrictions allow) to assist UN Country&#xA0;Teams/Humanitarian Country Teams.&#xA0;
OHCHR would activate the use of the Contingency Fund at the initiative of High Commissioner in response to:- Unexpected deteriorating or potentially deteriorating human rights situations- A request by a Representative of the United Nations system in a country&#xA0;- A request by an OHCHR Head of Field Presence; in support to inter-agency efforts, including during&#xA0;a humanitarian crisis.</narrative>
