   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- PPE FOR QUARANTINE VOLUNTEERS: This project provide focused support in preparation against the spread of COVID-19 in rural and peri-urban border areas. This will involve PPE at community quarantine facilities and information management support based on the feedback received from the government/facility managers at Myawaddy and district medical officers in Kwakeriek, village administration and at risk communities across all the townships including Thandaunggyi and Baw Ga Lae (a sub-township of Hpaan). 
- CASH ASSISTANCE: The assistance would also include multi purpose cash transfers to meet the multiple needs around health, hygiene and food both with the returnees/families and other vulnerable groups. Markets in the area are still functional and communities could procure basic food items and medicines.  

- KEY HEALTH MESSAGING: Further the initiative would be complimented by provision of information on COVID prevention and facilities in the identified townships. There is a need for funds for Covid-19 related awareness messaging which local organisations are not able to spread effectively. While community quarantine centres have been set up, they lack resources and effective monitoring of those in quarantine.</narrative>
