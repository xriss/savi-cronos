   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH response to  IDPs and Host Communities in Tirinkot, District, Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention is informed by an integrated Joint Needs Assessment that was undertaken by NCA and 4 other INGOs (Cordaid, People in Need (PiN), Terres des hommes (Tdh) and World Vision International (WVI)) between December 2019 and January 2020 in the seven prioritized provinces including, Uruzgan. The Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) assessment targeted the urgent and unmet WASH needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and underserved host community in Uruzgan&#x2019;s Trinkot district, Shah Mansor,Gogarak,Karizona,Kaftar Khana were identified as areas with the most affected and vulnerable communities, where IDPs and returnees are living in difficult circumstances with the majority not having access to sufficient quantities of safe drinking water, practicing open defecation (OD) due to lack of suitable sanitation facilities, and have little or no knowledge of proper hygiene practices.


NCA&#x2019;s proposed 1 year WASH program will provide critical WASH services to the conflict-affected population and underserved host communities in Uruzgan province improve overall WASH services for women, men, boys, girls and Persons with Specific Needs (PSNs) and reduce tensions between the host community and IDPs. The proposed project will reach 18,735  individuals of conflict IDPs (16,506) and underserved host community (2,229), ensuring that they have: 1) improved access to a safe water supply 2) improved access to adequate sanitation facilities 3) opportunities to practice safe hygiene practices. Water sources in the target areas are unsafe, as they can be both unprotected (where they present a hazard to people and animals in the area), contain contaminated water, and are over-stressed.


In collaboration with local authorities and communities, NCA and its partner will undertake WASH activities including the rehabilitation and maintenance of existing dysfunctional wells and water and sanitation systems (at one health center and two schools), water quality testing and establishment or support to existing WASH Committees and authorities to operate, repair and manage water structures. Simultaneously, new wells will be sunk in areas where no other sources of water are available. The project will also include a strong capacity-building component for local authorities, IDP and host community members and NCA and partner staff, involving training and support to effectively undertake their WASH activities. Hygiene Promoters will be engaged and supported to undertake hygiene promotion practices leading to health risk reduction. Hygiene sessions will focus on diarrhea prevention strategies, discouraging open defecation, proper household waste management and critical times to wash hands with soap, menstrual hygiene management, and safe household water treatment. Moreover, hygiene promotion sessions will rise awareness on prevention measures of COVID -19 through the dissemination of relevant IEC materials and the promotion of handwashing. 

The installation of lockable latrines, with handwashing facilities, in affected communities will curtail the spread of WASH-related diseases, ensure the privacy and security of women and children, and provide easy access for disabled persons and the elderly. Targeted households with a disability and elderly people will receive WASH services accordingly. Bathing facilities will be constructed to ensure personal hygiene, health, dignity, and well-being of project beneficiaries. Access to adequate sanitation facilities in the target clinics and schools, existing latrines will be rehabilitated. 2,358 families will receive hygiene kits, through vouchers.

This application is a joint proposal in line with NCA&#x2019;s partnership approach to build the capacity of national civil society organizations and to ensure transparent oversight and accountability during project implementation effectively.</narrative>
