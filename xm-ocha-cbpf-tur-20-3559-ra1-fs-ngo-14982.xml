   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency response life-saving food for the newly IDPs by providing ready to eat rations (RTERs) and food rations.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to emergency life-saving assistance to recently displaced populations by providing RTERs, and food rations by e-voucher modality to the newly vulnerable IDP families which displaced within the last 2 months due to the continuous dispute and conflict in NW Syria.
GAN will intervene through 2 activities:

1-Providing RTERs to 957 families(5533 individuals) of newly IDPs in Maaret Tamasrin 4 times each time enough for 5 persons for 5 days, this intervention is considered as a rapid response for affected IDPs those suffering from lack of resources, instability and don&#x2019;t have cooking facilities (this period of this type of assistance is recommended by FSL cluster).
GAN will distribute RTEs for each family two times each time the beneficiary will be delivered double quantity of RTE to decrease contacting between the beneficiaries and the teams from 4 to 2 times as a mitigation measure related to COVID-19

2-Providing food rations by e-voucher modality with the aim of saving lives and ensuring continued and regular access to food for 3 months, the proposed activity is designed according to the family size (13$ per person monthly)as follows:
1-2 people in a family: 26$
3 people:39$
4 people:52$
5 people:65$
6 people:78$ etc
GAN will target 1061 family (6104individuals) in Salqin and 500 families (2900 individuals) in Kafar Takharim of newly IDPs according to the following prioritization criteria:
- Families with: children below six (6) years old - elderly members - disabled members - severely ill members.
- Women and children headed HHs.
- Families who didn&apos;t receive humanitarian assistance in the new site.
Some vulnerable groups will have special consideration when delivering assistance like girls and women, elderly and people with disabilities, GAN will deliver these groups to their homes, it is expected that 5% of the targeted families will meet these criteria.
Each family head will receive the assistance package(includes the assistance terms, list of vendors, list of items, instructions, and voucher NFC card) and orientation session during the first preparatory month.
The family head will be able to use the e-voucher card immediately after the orientation sessions at the beginning of the second month. Starting from the second month, the beneficiary will be able to buy his/her needs among 40 specified items with restricted amounts that are allowed in the e-voucher card to fulfill the calorie standard set by the WFP.
Compared to other alternatives of disbursing cash, including paper vouchers, GAN chose to implement through e-voucher system based on many reasons, such as saving the dignity of beneficiaries and creates a safe space for IDPs to be engaged with the host communities, as to prevent of food basket selling which is frequently happened. The e-voucher system increases the variety of food items which has a good health and nutrition impact on beneficiaries for example they will be able to buy fresh meat, chicken, eggs and vegetables beside what they need of groceries especially during the month of Ramadan, as the month of Ramadan will be among the redemption vouchers process period.
GAN implemented similar project in 2019 in Afrin city under 2018 4th RA and the result of TPM was 100% of the surveyed beneficiaries felt comfortable to use the e-voucher system instead of other modalities.
MampE plan will be conducted during the project with PDM and a clear complaint mechanism for beneficiaries against vendors and employees.</narrative>
