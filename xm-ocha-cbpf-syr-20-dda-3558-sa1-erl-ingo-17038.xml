  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rescate team was exerting endeavors to respond to the 1st standard allocation objective (2) support mitigation of the socio-economic impacts stemming from economic and financial crisis in addition to restrictive measures to prevent COVID-19. Rescate based its studies on the ERL activities and indicators, as the sector has identified the following objectives for the planned intervention: 
Improve access to basic and social services and infrastructure B. Strengthen access to livelihoods by creating income-generating opportunities and by improving access to production and market infrastructure to restore local economy recovery. Hence, Rescate has visited several locations stated in the ERL priority areas to build its intervention in line with needs expressed by communities. The intervention is planning to respond to lifesaving needs for a market in Dayr Hafir in response to the emergency needs of the community to have a market which will ensure organization, services WASH and electricity, cleanliness, especially that the City Council lately established a market after four years of delay, but the municipality has received criticism from the city&apos;s residents due to the lack of services, so it was abandoned by sellers due to creating traffic jams, lack of services especially cleanliness.

Rescate has set the plan in coordination with the city council, the municipality and the community leaders including women and PWDs who are working in the streets at the Martyrs roundabout to secure minimum living costs, stated two sellers a woman and an adolescent with disability. Rescate has a written approval from the city council stating the needs and readiness to immediately start implementation of the project subject to fund availability (attached with translation). The location is decided, studies about the nearby public services are identified (water, sanitation, electricity, and cleanliness measures were conducted to decide on the infrastructure rehabilitation levels. A detailed BOQ is prepared with market studies for costs, the location scheme is prepared including facilities for 9 types of sales professions. The project aims at securing 50/50 male-female shares, the Market Committee have women represented. The socio-economic study result show women have a fundamental role in the rural areas because they work in the back scene in these areas on farming, livestock husbandry and dairy products in addition to preparing legume and fruits for sale (packaging, bundles, dried herbs and sweets, and syrups etc.). Therefore rehabilitation the market per say will create an optimum place to display their products, hence will positively impact on their production and will improve their income. During consultations and the community involvement in designing the project, women were represented and wanted their males to be in the front-line and work at the market so they work back to back, &#x201C;extracted from eventual meetings&#x201D;. The market committee will be encouraged to persuade that each stand will have females to work with males at site because each stand requires two individuals to run it, women will be encouraged to share the work at the stands so they guarantee direct income and freedom to benefit from their work. 


Rescate is committed to submit 4Ws and reports to cover progress and achievements, MampE, financial and narrative reports to the sector and donors. Rescate coordinates with DINGO to ensure no duplication of services amongst the acting partners.</narrative>
