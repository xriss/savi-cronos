   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing livelihood opportunities and improve access to social services to conflict-affected populations in Aleppo governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to contribute to the improved resilience of conflict-affected populations in Northwest Syria by enhancing access to livelihood opportunities and basic services for women and men in Qabasin area, Al-Bab and Arima subdistricts, Aleppo governorate. IYD will achieve this objective by the implementation of the following integrated activities :

1-	support 200- selected HHs with vocational training, including four types of training courses determined based on the needs assessment conducted by IYD in the targeted community. Accordingly, IYD will implement the following trainings:

	To decrease the impact of COVID-19, training on home manufacturing of soap and general sewing ( including masks) will be conducted to 100 selected trainees (50 trainees per training type), and by the end of the training, the best ten of them will receive productive tool kits to launch their own business.

	 The other types of training will be on soft skills of data management and Ms office for 100 trainees to raise the targeted trainees&#x2019; chances in securing long-term job opportunities. IYD, after this training, will recruit the best ten trainees for two months in IYD and other NGOs operating in the targeted areas, obtaining the practical experience, and IYD will pay their salaries as a business grant. 

Each of these trainings will last for one month (20 working days/4-hour duration daily), and the trainees will be required to attend a minimum of 80% of the sessions. It is important to state that IYD, which has developed biosecurity and contingency plans to alleviate the COVID 19 risk, will apply and highly take into consideration all preventive measures recommended by the health cluster. Of them, small training groups, physical distancing, wearing masks and gloves, availability of disinfection machines and sanitation items, etc. Besides, the woman trainees will be provided with child care service within a dedicated room within the center run by a female babysitter. 

2-	IYD will conduct two community support activities that improve the whole community&#x2019;s access to basic services and assist Qabasin population.

Based on need assessment discussed in the needs section of this proposal, the population in Qabasin community is suffering from damaged roads that connect the farmers to markets in the city center and damaged sewage. To address that, IYD will conduct the following activities:
	IYD will rehabilitate 12 KM of roads in Qabasin and surrounding areas. These roads are connecting farmers to markets this will reduce the financial burden on farmers by decreasing the depreciation of their vehicles and minimize the transportation cost of production from farms to markets.

	Likewise, IYD will rehabilitate the damaged sewage system in Qabasin community because the sewage water accumulates near the houses, and this causes diseases and bad smells.  

3-	Provision of Cash for Work to vulnerable households:

By this activity, IYD will provide temporary job opportunities in the form of cash for work modality for 500 selected beneficiaries, and these workers will implement community activities as follow:

	50-targeted workers will receive training on preventive measures against COVID-19, then they will work as promoters in markets to raise the populat&#x131;on awareness about COVID-19  preventive measures.

	450-skilled and unskilled workers will work in the above-mentioned community support activities (rehabilitation of roads and sewage system and other community activities)
.
Here is important to mention that IYD will sign contracts with targeted workers to determine the start date of work, daily work hours, contract duration, daily wages, type of activity ( according to IYD cash for work SoPs, the targeted worker should works 7 hours daily for 22 days per month). Besides, IYD determines $ 7.5 for skilled workers per day, while the unskilled worker will receive $ 6 per day accordin</narrative>
