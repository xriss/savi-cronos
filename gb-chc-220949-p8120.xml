   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The French Red Cross (FRC) has been operational in Northern Iraq alongside the Iraqi Red Crescent (IRCS) since 2013, especially in Dohuk, Ninewah and Erbil governorates so far. Focused first on the influx of Syrian refugees, then on the IDP crisis and the challenging displacements and returns of population, FRC provides assistance in a range of sectors including WASH, livelihoods, education, shelter and relief in cooperation with the IRCS Current programming includes WASH, Livelihoods, Education and Psychosocial Support and Disasters Preparedness and Disasters Reduction thematic. Mainstreaming of the capacity building of the Iraqi Red Crescent (IRCS) in FRC&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s daily work is also a main priority. Sinjar District in Northern Iraq is still facing a number of challenges following the liberation in 2015 from ISIS, with a large amount of the population still being displaced within Iraq. The current outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying lockdowns and curfews have put additional economic pressure on the population. In recent months, an increase in returns of IDPs to Sinjar could be observed, 14,704 individuals (2,711 families) have arrived between 8 June and 12 August 2020 (IOM data). With much of the houses, farms, and key infrastructure destroyed or still contaminated with unexploded ordinance, people returning are facing difficulties re-establishing their livelihoods.Present in Sinjar since 2016, FRC has visited several of the affected communities currently receiving returnees in August 2020, and in addition has collected information from secondary sources such as UNHCR, district representatives, and local NGOs. All sources confirm water supply as one of the key needs.&#xC2;&#xA0;
&#xC2;&#xA0;
BRC completed an evaluation of one of the programmes; Cash-For-Work (CFW) through WASH project in Iraq in 2019 and found the cash-based component of the project was successful. The evaluation report recommended implementing remaining Iraq appeal funds in Sinjar to build on the previous WaSH and CFW implemented in that area and to support people, including SGBV survivors, impacted by displacement and protracted conflict.&#xC2;&#xA0; Therefore, the Iraq WaSH and MPCA project in Sinjar has two key areas of work: firstly the rehabilitation of two boreholes for recently returned IDPs to stop the dependence on water trucking. Secondly a one-off MPCA for 115 HHs and 50 GBV survivor households.&#xC2;&#xA0;
