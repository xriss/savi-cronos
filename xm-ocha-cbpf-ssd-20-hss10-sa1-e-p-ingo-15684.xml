  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to meet the immediate, medium and long-term educational needs of the target communities in Bor South county, Jonglei State. Polish Humanitarian Action (PAH) and Christian Mission Development (CMD) will target 7 schools in Bor South with 6180 students, 63 teachers and 21 PTA and community members. PAH and CMD will target schools that no partner is supporting with infrastructure including TLS and WASH as well as PSS activities, and activities targeting improved learning environment through access to teaching and learning materials, training.


PAH will target schools for improving the infrastructure, including constructing and renovating TLS spaces, WASH facilities construction and rehabilitation. In addition, the protection component of PAH&#x2019;s activities will focus on PSS, PFA for children as well as awareness raising on child protection and GBV  prevention, management and mitigation. This will aim at reducing the risks of GBV, child labor, early marriage, also to reduce the level of waterborne diseases, and increase school&#x2019;s attendance. CMD will focus on providing textbooks, teaching and learning supplies, ECD kits and relevant trainings. 


Holistic package of messaging on disease prevention, sanitation and hygiene, training of teachers and communities on health related issues and psychosocial support trainings will be conducted jointly with PAH and CMD. 
Addressing TLS and WASH needs will improve enrollment and continuity of learners in school as lack of basic essential services such as learning space, water, sanitation and poor hygiene can lead to diseases outbreak that pose threat to the children. PAH and CMD will mainly do this by:
a) Rehabilitation/installation of hand washing facilities: The hand washing facilities will be established or the existing ones repaired to support hand washing at critical times in the schools.
b) Rehabilitation/Establishment of latrines: focus on sanitation in school/learning spaces with aim of cholera prevention, preparedness and response through provision of emergency latrine where no school latrines is available. Gender disaggregated sanitation facilities will be improved in 7 schools through both construction and rehabilitation of existing latrines. Health clubs will promote good hygiene among the learners to keep them safe from water borne diseases.
c) COVID -19 related activities in schools and communities such as awareness raising on symptoms, prevention, child protection risks relating to COVID 19, provision of PPEs for PAH staff and teachers, and supply of handwashing facilities and soap
d) Training of school-based community groups (Parents Teacher Associations (PTAs), School Management Committees (SMCs), teachers and adolescents/youth) on hygiene messaging on disease symptoms, modes of transmission and prevention, referral to treatment/health facility. 
e)Establishment/repair of non-functional water points nearby schools and construction of rain water harvesting systems to ensure that the schools/learning spaces have access to safe water for drinking and personal hygiene and ensure that there is water for the hand washing facilities to be used
f) Provide psychosocial support through trainings targeting specifically teachers, school&#x2019;s authorities, parent-teacher association members, local administration. Protection information sessions will be held at schools and community levels, in relation to Education, GBV, child&#x2019;s rights and protection risks on community and school level.
g) Conduct schools and community awareness sessions on Child Protection, Gender Based Violence reducing children&#x2019;s risks and ensuring their safe access to learning facilities based on Community Based Child Protection structures.
h) provide teaching and learning materials to 7 schools for improved learning environment, including ECD kits for ECD centers.
