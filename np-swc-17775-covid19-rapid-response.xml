   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will increase the preparedness of Anandaban Hospital to deliver critical COVID-19 care to patients experiencing COVID-19 complications including vulnerable individuals including people affected by leprosy and disabilities and to protect the most vulnerable and health workers from infection. The project will do this by training all staff in COVID-19 response including testing, treating, and managing cases; opening an isolation ward aimed to treat critical patients using ventilators and respirators; providing counselling sessions for both staff and patients struggling with their experience of COVID-19; sharing awareness-raising messages about how to keep safe during the pandemic; and by distributing food and sanitation packages amongst households in the local community.</narrative>
