   <narrative xml:lang="EN">159 Damaged houses rehabilitation in Aleppo, Al Shaar</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 1st Standard Allocation intention is to &#x201C;address humanitarian needs in underserved areas, as based on the severity of needs and the current humanitarian response&#x201D;, coupled with the Shelter Sector Objective 2: Strengthen the resilience and cohesion of vulnerable communities by improving housing and related community or public infrastructure. Hence this project is designed to meet the dire need of returnees&#x2019; population in Jebel Samaan where the severity is 4 and [PiN is 636121.2], and (HNAP) July 2020 report 84,395 returnees. Rescate had finished 390 rehabilitation of damaged houses in 2019 in Al Shaar neighborhood. Noting that the area is eventually underserved in Aleppo per the outcome of the workshop in 2019 between the acting parties/sector and the governorate because it constitutes of ~5000 houses, yet interventions were limited to rehabilitation of Rescate 390 houses, ADRA 13 and DRC 16 [from Rescate]. 
The objective of the project is to rehabilitate damaged houses for vulnerable returnees 75% and people who stayed in their houses under the fighting 25%. Rescate will build its intervention on the remained houses from the previous project as Rescate is granted approval from MOLAE for the rehabilitation of 437 houses. Rescate finished only 390 houses due to lack of funding, the remaining 47 houses, Rescate transferred 16 to DRC available fund, while the remaining 31 are still awaiting without been rehabilitated and which BoQs and approvals are ready (attached). Under this Allocation, Rescate is submitting the proposal to rehabilitate the ready for implementation 31 houses, in addition to 128 (total 159) based on the added value of saving time, efforts, and costs since Rescate already has field assessment and detailed BOQs. The final approval procedures from MOLAE, require 6 weeks during which the first 31 will be ongoing. In coordination with the municipality, a desk will be set at the Mayor office to review beneficiaries&#x2019; HLP dox. Rescate will submit the intact files for MOLAE final approval.
Rescate will announce in newspapers amp Facebook call for contractors&#x2019; bids for the works. The contract award will be processed per Rescate procurement policy. Due to current unstable currency and market prices, Rescate will encourage contractors to submit proposals by giving the awarded contractors (two for risk mitigation) a down-payment of 30% on condition they immediately purchase the materials as per sample written approvals. Rescate team will inspect the materials at warehouses. 
The awarded contractors will start rehabilitation of the 1st Lots 20+11 from the ready approved houses. However, contractors will be asked to carry out the works with space segregation for Corona measures: All persons at site will be strictly using PPEs at all working-hours.
1) Works will be carried out in Lots of 20 each time
2) Each type of works will be carried out by a sub-contractor at each time, such as painting, sanitation, doors amp windows, wood, electrical works in one Lot at any one time, then 2nd Lot starts.
Rescate will finalize the procedure for the approvals of the 128 remaining apartments during the implementation of the first Lot 31 houses which is an added advantage for Rescate.
It is worth to state that Rescate engineering team are ready to start working with the gained experience from the 1st project in the same area of intervention. Rescate already obtained the structure safety licenses from the Syndicate for 65 green buildings under this intervention while the remaining 46 buildings license will be obtained accordingly. Rescate will work in the buildings where the common areas have already been concluded under the previous project, it is a positive impact on the cost. Rescate will reflect any savings from the fund by adding houses, with consideration to the vulnerability score  (FHHs, CHHs, elderly, families with PWDs) in addition to those who lost their jobs to COVID-19</narrative>
