  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project is to provide immediate, lifesaving educational access to formal/non formal education combined with social emotional learning/ PSS activities, physically in schools or through distance modalities  to 7,357 children, (89.8% IDPs, 10.2% Host community) 4.089 girls, 3,268 boys, 193 CwD) in Idlib and Rural Aleppo in NW Syria from July 1st until June 2021 in 26 learning spaces. The focus is on increasing access and improving the quality of education as well as safety and COVID-19 preparedness and mitigations.

To ensure teacher well being and high performance, SR will provide teacher incentives, teacher kits, internet for connection, materials to provide SLP to children with no access to internet, and ongoing learning using a package of contextualized trainings and capacity buildings to assist them to deliver quality education, as well as through monthly learning circles at each school. Supervision and coaching channels will be used to monitor implementation and provide continuous support. 

To secure child well being and participation, SR will provide recreational materials, student stationary bags and internet for children to access online education and exercise books/SLP materials for children with no access to online education. Children who have access to smart phones and the ones who don&#x2019;t will benefit through adaptable modalities (SLP - Online platforms) based on the formal curriculum.  In addition, SR will provide PSS/ SEL as a fundamental part of the project aiming to improve the wellbeing and learning capacity of children, who are traumatized by years of war and isolation. Teachers in this project will focus on social and emotional 5 competencies through online distance platforms and SLP after adapting the activities, using only those that can be delivered remotely. During the COVID-19 situation, SR will continue providing children with distance learning, through which children will continue learning. SR will provide increased catch up, recreational activities and SEL in the summer and in the first two weeks lock down is over to compensate for the time lost in the 2019/2020 academic year by schools that closed due to conflict and/or COVID-19. This will facilitate integration back to formal learning (see summer activity and SEL activity handbook annex). In the 2020/2021 school year, formal education with be provided with supplementary basic literacy and numeracy classes to support children in the areas of their study they are falling behind in or find problematic and improve their learning outcomes
To guarantee mobilizing the community to deliver this education to the children, teachers will pay regular visits to parents to give them regular weekly/biweekly plans and will follow up separately with children and teachers. Once suspension finishes, Back to Learning (BTL) campaigns will be conducted to increase awareness on the importance of education and to promote a return to learning. Awareness and outreach campaigns will be conducted with a focus on identifying and removing barriers to increase enrolment and attendance of the most vulnerable groups and with main COVID-19 messages that SR will be providing through online platforms and other methods
To improve the learning environment, SR will do small rehabilitation as needed (e.g. gender/disability sensitive WASH facilities), provide school furniture, and cover school operational costs, including fuel for heating in winter.

In terms of emergency preparedness and COVID-19 response, the emergency preparedness plans include disaster reduction information, emergency evacuation plans and drills, and school-level checklists of tasks to improve preparedness. COVID-19 awareness will be mainstreamed through awareness sessions, sterilizing of schools, and for children, activities, such as storytelling in distance learning, readings, online brochures, etc. SR will use schools as a window of knowledge and sharing to spread awareness in the community</narrative>
