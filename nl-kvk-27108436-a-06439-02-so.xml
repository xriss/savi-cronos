   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this part of the world where displacement and utmost poverty are prevalent with no properly
functioning health systems, it is hard to imagine how adversely impactful a COVID-19 outbreak will be.
People are already extremely vulnerable to bear yet another distressing crisis. While all countries need to
respond to COVID-19, countries with existing humanitarian crisis coupled with weak governance are
particularly vulnerable. When COVID-19 affects countries with protracted humanitarian crises like
Somalia/land, vulnerable populations, particularly women headed households, the disabled and the
elderly living in overcrowded camps or informal urban settlements will be highly vulnerable to the disease
and its social and economic impacts unless support is given on preventative measures.The number of
people in need of humanitarian assistance in Somalia, around 5.2 million currently, will likely sharply
increase in the event of COVID-19 outbreak making the already fragile situation much worse. The Locust
infestation is another evolving crisis andif not addressed will also have significant impact on the food
security and livelihoods of the people.
COVID-19 crisis will have a different and far-reaching impact on poor people, especially the vulnerable.
Anyone can be exposed to the virus but the poor are most vulnerable as they lack financial and social
protections. Overcrowded IDP settlements and poor urban slums are also going to be the places where
disease can spread easily and quickly. To effectively address the urgent and acute humanitarian dimension
of the crisis, we need to frame that within our understanding of how inequality plays out. Women will be
as susceptible to getting infected by the virus but their need for support is greater because, as in any crisis,
women including elderly women, bear the greater responsibility of caring for the family and making both
ends meet. Women#s multiple burdens of needing to contribute to the household income while also taking
care of the young, theelderly and the sick mean they have the longest days, the shortest rest and the
highest stress, making them easy targets of disease.
Containment measures and their economic fallout are likely to hurt more than the disease itself, and for
longer. Restrictions on movement and market access will affect many households# income and coping
strategies in Somalia/land, including households who were relatively well off before the pandemic. As well
as short term support we need to consider howto provide support to those affected over the longer term.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2004 Oxfam Novib set up a Liaison Office in Nairobi, Kenya in order to support the Strengthening Somali Civil Society Program, at the request of the EU. This request was based on Oxfam Novib&apos;s work in Somalia to date, but intended to be more widely directed atthe entire civil society sector and the specific context in which it is operating in a post-conflict country. The program started with consulting local organisations in Somalia and Somaliland to get a complete picture of the sectors and regions where they are active, the challenges they face and the relationship between civil society, local political structures and the private sector. A program was then developed to strengthen the institutional development of Oxfam Novib&apos;s partners and those of other Oxfams, as well as a range of new NGOs.
In the first year local consultants were trained in Somalia. They were then seconded to civil society organisations to build their capacity in financial and organisational management. Furthermore, workshops were organised on specific themes suchas human rights and the role of civil society in the Somali context. The Liaison Office is now going to support the expansion of the program, focussing on strengthening both organisation and project management, while facilitating more training in the fields of civic education, governance, human rights and women&apos;s rights, HIV and AIDS and child protection.
Over the years, the Somalia Country Office has expanded its intervention on short term humanitarian response as well as development development interventions. In 2015/2016, a decision was reached to move the Country Programme operation, which was largely in Nairobi, from Nairobi to Hargeisa. The country office has a small office in Nairobi , Kenya and large operations office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.</narrative>
