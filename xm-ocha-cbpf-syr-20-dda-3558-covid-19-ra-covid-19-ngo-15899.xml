   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Equipping and Rehabilitation 2nd floor of Al-Birr Hospital as an Isolation center for affected by COVID-19</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the current response of COVID-19, AL-Birr played its role in the national efforts of fighting COVID-19 and managed to rehabilitate the 8th floor of its building and convert it to an isolation center with a capacity of 24 beds for isolation and treatment and 20 bed-ICU for the treatment of severe cases where continuous supply of oxygen is needed. All of it are equipped with monitors and ventilators. Also Al-Birr managed to convert the out-patient clinics department to quarantine center with a capacity of 27 beds. The quarentine and isolation centers have seperated enterances.
All of this was with support of local donors who trusts Al-Birr since the association have a good reputation and earned the society trust through its humanitarian work since 1956.

The Hospital now is one of the approved centers by the directorate of health in Homs for the treatment of affected people by COVID-19 (DoH letter is attached).


In order to be more prepared and ready in case of any outbreak of the pandemic, and since Homs city has no enough public hospitals nor enough intensive care units and beds, Al-Birr project aims to increase the capacity of Al-Birr isolation center for COVID-19 and of Homs governorate in general in order to save lives of people might be affected by the virus. Therefore, the project will complete the rehabilitation process of ICU department (which was the largest ICU in Homs during the last decade) in the second floor of the hospital building, and convert it  to an isolation center.
The rehabilitation needed for the 2nd floor is only minor rehabilitation work such as some carpentry and aluminum work, installing doors and windows, light plumping and electrical work. The rehabilitation could be achieved in a month at the latest, Al-Birr has enough equipment for this floor, the project will help to purchase and equip the isolation center with needed devices (beds and its accessories) to be added to the available devices. After rehabilitation, the capacity of Al-Birr hospital ICU will be 30 beds in addition to its current 20 ICU beds. So, Al-Birr will be able to provide treatment for 60 patients monthly (300 patients in 5 months)

&#x650;According to Chinese reports, CT plays &#x201C;a vital role in early detection, observation, and disease evaluation.&#x201D;. While RT-PCR sensitivity do not exceed 70%, CT-scan will ensure rapid improved quarantining, and tailored public health measures.
Al-Birr Hospital has one of the best and developed multi-slice computed tomography scan devices in Syria that has the ability to do 128-slides scans. This device could significantly contribute in the efforts of detecting the affected cases by COVID-19 but it needs maintenance (replacing its x ray tube) that could be conducted in 1-2 months and and the project aims to rehabilitate it and put it in work to support the detection, observation and evaluating diseases of affected people where 600 patients may benefit of these scans</narrative>
