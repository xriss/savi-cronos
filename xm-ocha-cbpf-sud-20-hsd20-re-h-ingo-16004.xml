   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COVID-19 in Red Sea State: prevent and inform to ensure continuity of healthcare services for the most vulnerable communities in Port Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at contributing towards the strengthening of capacities within the Health Sector to prepare and deliver timely humanitarian assistance to populations affected by conflict, natural emergencies, and disease outbreaks. In line with Strategic Priority 1, it is intended to contain the spread of the current COVID-19 pandemic in the targeted location, through the proposed logic of intervention. More specifically, the project&apos;s main outcome is to contribute to decreasing morbidity and mortality among the most vulnerable communities in Sudan, while ensuring continuity of standard health services provided by EMERGENCY Centre in Port Sudan. 
The outputs under the proposed intervention are in line with the three prioritized pillars of the Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP) targeted under the Reserve for Emergency (RfE) for COVID-19. 

Adequate risk communication (output 1) will be ensured by disseminating Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) guidance and key messages through health promotion sessions to be held within EMERGENCY facility throughout the project lifespan. A softer outreach component will be guaranteed by means of health sensitization through car bullhorns, to reach out to population living in the catchment area of the facility. Risk communication materials will be prepared in local language and distributed to patients visiting the facility.
IPC will be reinforced by means of up-to-date COVID-19 trainings for EMERGENCY staff within Port Sudan health facility (output 2). Training sessions and refreshers will be organised on a monthly basis and based on both internal protocols, as well as WHO and UNICEF guidelines. Such activities are key strengten the preventive component of the COVID-19 response moreover, safe and informed medical staff are well positioned to keep on providing standard healthcare services to those residing in Port Sudan and surrounding districts. In the context of the current pandemic, it is paramount to prevent disruption of healthcare assistance, vis-&#xE0;-vis structural weaknesses of the Sudanese national health system.

Finally, case management will be strengthened through establishment of surveillance and referral mechanisms with the main hospital in Port Sudan, as well as by means of specific measures within EMERGENCY facility (output 3). In line with EMERGENCY&apos;s protocols and drawing upon lessons learnt during the Ebola response in West Africa, patient flows have been reorganized compartmentalization of the facility has been undertaken and a further isolation tent will be set up for suspected COVID-19 cases which might be detected by EMERGENCY staff and referred to the main hospital.</narrative>
