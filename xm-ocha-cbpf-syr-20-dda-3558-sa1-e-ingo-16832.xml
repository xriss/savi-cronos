   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to increase equitable access to quality education in safe and protected environment for crisis affected children and youth in Hama district of Syria. The proposed intervention targets 4000 children in five localities (Murak, Kafr Zeata, Karnaz, Braideej and Halfaya) that have recently shifted control. In addition, there has been an influx of IDP&#xB4;s from Idlib. The influx has increased the needs in the area, which currently has low number of active partners.   


The proposed action will provide access  to education for 2500 children who have lost, or are at risk of losing access to education through age and grade appropriate catch-up and remedial classes. These classes use MoE approved content, including the accelerated curricula B. The selection of beneficiaries will address specific needs related to gender, disability and seek to integrate children who lack legal documents and identification. A further 1500 in-school children in targeted localities will benefit from school kits, students kits and hygiene kits. The project will indirectly benefit the families and communities with an approximate reach of 20 000 indirect beneficiaries.


The quality of education will be reinforced through this intervention, as the majority of teachers in Syria are not certified. This action will ensure that teachers receive a training before they engage with remedial or catch-up classes. These trainings are based on INEE&#x2019;s Teachers in Crisis Context (TiCC) training package intended for underqualified teachers in crisis contexts. TiCC includes modules on planning for teaching, teaching strategies, classroom management, special needs of girls and boys in learning environment and inclusive learning. Teachers will also receive trainings in child safeguarding and key child protection related themes such as GBV. A total of 40 teachers will be trained during the course of this project. 

Safe, physical school environments will be ensured through the rehabilitation of 62 classrooms in 5 schools. The rehabilitations will ensure that currently overcrowded schools will have an adequate number of safe, equipped classrooms and disability inclusive, gender segregated WASH facilities. The equipment of classrooms and facilities will take into account the specific requirements imposed by COVID-19. 

The project builds protective environments by supporting the psychosocial well-being of conflict affected children. Teachers will receive training in understanding the fundaments of Psychosocial Support to enable them to identify symptoms of distress in children. This will enable teachers to refer children who exhibit symptoms of anxiety to specialised services. A referral services and pathway mapping will be conducted together with the school community. 

The project will also involve broader communities through creation of school protection committees, to ensure the participation of caregivers. Together with protection committees, interactive and participatory protection events will be organised in each school on key topics - early marriage and gender based violence (GBV), Child labour, ERW and COVID-19. 

The risk of the spread of COVID-19 will be mitigated through distribution of hygiene material including soap, sanitizers, gloves and masks. Hand washing posters will be provided and placed in key locations near hand washing facilities. Disinfectant will be provided for classrooms to ensure the environment stays clean. In case of school closures due to COVID-19, teaching will be provided to students using remote methods, Self Learning Program (SLP), WhatsApp and / or radio teaching. All monitoring and evaluation activities will be carried out, taking into account COVID19 guidance and ensuring the safety of beneficiaries.</narrative>
