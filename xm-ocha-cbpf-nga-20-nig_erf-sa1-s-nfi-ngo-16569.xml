   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Scaling-up Emergency Shelters and Improved NFIs for IDPs (Old and New Arrivals) in camps and Host Communities in MMC and Jere LGAs of Borno State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Conflict affected population in Borno are experiencing unimaginable nightmares, with the beginning of the rains which is usually accompanied with heavy/strong sandstorms, winds and the rains. In the past weeks the heavy rains/winds have already rendered many homeless as their emergency shelters and NFIs have been destroyed, coupled with already over congested camps.
This project proposed by GREENCODE titled &#x2019;Scaling-up Emergency Shelters and Improved NFIs for IDPs (Old and New Arrivals) in camps and Host Communities in MMC and Jere LGAs of Borno State is a 9 month designed to contribute to closing some of the emergency and NFI gaps as assessed by our team, CCCM partners and compiled by the CCCM and Shelter/NFI sector. 

The urgent need for this project is as a result of increasing displacement of populations from other locations/LGAs into MMC and Jere LGAs couple with the destruction of shelter by wind-storm and fire outbreaks in the past few months. Majority of the displaced people have been sleeping in very inhumane conditions without any form of shelter and NFIs as reported by our project team and Sector Shelter/NFI gap report of May, 2020.
The sector shelter/NFI gap analysis shows that Maiduguri alone has shelter gap of 17,498 and 5,378 households are without NFIs kits. Similarly, Jere LGA that is hosting majority of the conflict affected population need 22,751 shelters and 5,822 households need NFI kits. This figure is mostly likely to increase with the rains as most shelter will be destroyed by both rains/heavy wind-storm and floods.

This project will be focusing only on the construction of emergency shelters for those in congested shelters as well as those whose shelter/NFIs kits have been destroyed by rain/windstorms in the last couple of weeks or months as well as provision of improved NFI kits to the most vulnerable in MMC and Jere LGAs of Borno state. Series of activities for this project will include, community social mobilization, meeting with land owners and CCCM of the camps, Shelter/NFI gap re-assessment, beneficiary registration, procurement of shelter/NFI kits, warehousing, transportation, direct distribution of improved NFIs and post distribution monitoring every two weeks after distribution as the distribution will be done on a rolling-on-going bases and according to the needs and sector directives.
In implementing this project GREENCODE will work closely with the Sector and the state/nationally approved guidelines and standard as uploaded in the Humanitarian Response Info website. 
Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed project will adopt the Sector design COVID-19 implementation/distribution strategy as well as include COVID-19 kits as additional package in the improved NFI kits.
The project will be implemented in partnership with Local Community Development Initiative (LOCDIN) who is also an active member of CCCM/Shelter/NFI partner  and has  experience in camp management and shelter issues, so in this project LOCDIN will be leading in Land Advocacy, training of Enumerators for Shelter Assessment and join GREENCODE in weekly and monthly monitoring of both shelter and NFI distribution. and other project activities.</narrative>
