   <narrative xml:lang="EN">provide life-saving assistance to people facing severe food insecurity. The design of the intervention is based on the sectors directly related to the locust infestation (FSL + MPC), in line with the cluster recommendations, based on the expertise of partners and complementarity with other ongoing interventions. The intervention will target the most vulnerable HHs, to improve direct access to food, protect and rebuild livelihoods, which contributes to the structural approach addressing the infestation. All responses are adapted to the current COVID-19 pandemic, and activities are carried out in a way to minimise risk to both staff and beneficiaries and reduce the spread. Most interventions incorporate activities to raise awareness on hygiene and disease prevention, and in some cases respond directly with additional Health and WASH interventions. Partners will work in rural as well as urban areas, depending on the locally identified needs. Across all areas, relevant cluster, SPHERE, and CHS standards are followed.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In its February 20, 2020 update, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) declared that the Desert Locust infestation problem had covered eight countries in East Africa, namely Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, and lately, Uganda, Tanzania, and South Sudan. The situation has been described to be of an alarming status for Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, where it is feared to have potentially threatened the countries&#x2019; food security and livelihood systems. The crisis has been rated to be the worst in 25 years for Ethiopia, although it has spread and damaged further more since. In the last 20 days in Ethiopia, the numbers of regions and districts affected by the DL have increased from 6 to 7 and from 153 to 173, respectively, thereby further threatening the country&#x2019;s cash crop and bread basket areas. Region wise, only Gambella and Benishangul Gumuz regions have remained unaffected. Observations on the ground show that the DL infestation must have caused large-scale damages on the performance of the country&#x2019;s livestock and crop production as well as on its forest coverage, thereby worsening food security situations. Areas so far affected by the DL roughly overlap with woredas already experiencing chronic food insecurity, and hence targets for the humanitarian response plan (HRP).</narrative>

  <sector code="FSL SECTOR" percentage="100" vocabulary="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food security and livelihoods 30% of the budget will go to FSL. Depending on the local circumstances, food security interventions will be done either through food/cash vouchers or food-for-work modality, enabling HHs to purchase food from local markets wherever possible. Partners will include market assessments to determine the feasible modality to adopt for the project to adjust to any potential economic volatility. Besides direct food assistance, rehabilitation of productive assets through vouchers/food for work (specifically to combat the locust infestation and/or improve agricultural land), provision of tools for agricultural rehabilitations, small livestock and distribution of goats, vegetable seeds and organic fertilizer will be part of the approach to rebuild livelihoods. Communities will be trained/sensitized on preparation and response to combating the locust infestation, as well as food handling, preparation and preservation, vegetable production, climate smart agriculture, small livestock management and post-harvest management training. Training and provision of tools and inputs for garden/kitchen farming will have an impact on the longer-term food security of the communities, reinforcing their capacities and resilience in areas that are already combating recurring drought. Cash Both conditional and unconditional modalities will be used in this intervention, depending on needs, household ability and local circumstances. The most vulnerable HHs will be targeted for the receipt of unconditional MPC, including PLW, female-headed households, child-headed households, elders without caregivers, orphans, people with disabilities and other with known and identified vulnerabilities. Cash for work (CFW) activities will target for 5 manual labour and will target only the transitory food insecure pastoral/agro pastoral/farmer households severely affected by desert locust. CFW benefits both recipients of cash as well as the wider community through the rehabilitation of community assets. CFW activities include ground control interventions and distribution of CfW tools. Specific COVID guidelines from the clusters will be followed. As a safety measure, cash is transferred mostly via digital/mobile means, to ensure that no money is handled. WASH WASH activities will focus on awareness raising around hygiene promotion, the installation of handwashing stations, distribution of hygiene kits/PPE and disinfection of public spaces. In some areas, partners will repair and rehabilitate wells, construct water springs, and install water storage barrels. COVID-19 handwashing facilities will also be installed at public gathering places including markets and IDP centers and health/nutrition centers In some areas, the installation/preparation of bore holes will also be supported. Hygiene promotion: Public information campaigns in the project areas on how to protect yourself and others from the COVID-19 virus to prevent the spread of COVID, to reach the most affected households. Several information and education materials will be developed (leaflets, posters etc.) , printed and distributed to target households in local language to address key measures of COVID-19 virus prevention education. In Somalia, a call center for questions on COVID-19 has been established together by Oxfam and the Ministry of Health, this will be promoted across all partners in Somalia. Health Save the Children will train health care workers on COVID-19 drug guidelines and MHPSS. The health workers will be provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).</narrative>
