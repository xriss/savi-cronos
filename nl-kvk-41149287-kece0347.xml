       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A total of 3,751 boys were safeguarded. Out of the total; 2,494 boys went through counselling  issues like abuse(Physical, Neglect and Abandonment), reproductive health, et cetera. 1,257 were referred to the Children office, Chief&#x2019;s office, Kenya Police, Court, and CSO&apos;s like red cross and MSF for support.  Childline&#x2019;s case management team is following up these cases with the different service providers and the clients to ensure delivery of quality service.  No children were rescued during this period. The target was not reached because the contract with the donor was signed late. However, plans have been made to meet the target in the subsequent months. There is an under expenditure because project staff salary for the month of July was not paid due to delay in signing of the contract;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Covid- 19 awareness messages were shared through Childline&#x2019;s social media pages i.e. Facebook and Twitter where 1371 people were reached. The target was not met because, peer educators delayed in giving feedback on the messages before they could be used.  Since more children will be engaged in October 2020, they will be able to interact with the awareness messages and provide feedback. To meet the target, daily posting of the messages on social media and frequent boosting will be done. The messages will also be shared through TV and Radio stations.  The funds allocated to this activity were never used because only few messages had been shared. With the frequent boosting of the social media messages and airing via mass media in the coming month the budget will be utilized.;</narrative>
