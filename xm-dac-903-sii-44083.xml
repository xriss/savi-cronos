   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment consists of a one-year, renewable , senior loan for up to US$60 million to Banco M&#xFA;ltiple BHD Le&#xF3;n, S.A. (BHDL or the Bank) in the Dominican Republic (the DR or the Country) under the FIG COVID-19 Emergency Response WCS Envelope (WCS Envelope). The WCS Envelope is designed to provide funding to existing IFC client banks in emerging markets that will then extend new trade-related or working capital loans to companies whose cash flows have been disrupted by the global outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The proposed investment intends to support a strategic partner and a leading financial institution in the Country, by supporting the Bank&apos;s working capital and trade-related lending programs to DR enterprises, primarily small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under the COVID-19 Facility, the project&apos;s development thesis is: by supporting its clients&apos; capacity to sustain operations during this acute shock, IFC best positions the private sector to support the economic recovery process, shortening the time it will take for the most vulnerable to return to their traditional income-earning opportunities. 

The expected project-level outcome is providing access to finance/liquidity to relevant stakeholders (emerging markets &quot;EM&quot; and financial institutions &quot;FI&quot;, and through them, their customers). This will support stakeholders&apos; capacity to sustain operations and to expedite post-crisis recovery. Specifically, this project intends to provide increased access to working capital finance primarily for SMEs.

Beyond the project-level outcomes, EM banks provide working capital and trade finance to support their customers&apos; operating cash flows. By sustaining the Bank&apos;s ability to provide these services, the project intends to promote the resilience of trade finance markets as well as broader stability that comes about by providing for the going concern of market participants in the Dominican Republic.</narrative>
