Somali Region is the highest number of persons with the most severe protection concern, and Qohle town IDP site is among 10 identified sites by Shelter/NFI cluster which demands an integrated response to protection, GBV cases and fears to the safety, dignity, and wellbeing of women, children, people with disability and other who have a special vulnerability (2020 humanitarian needs overview).  

The proposed integrated emergency project attempts to intervene in IDPs in Qohle sites who live in overcrowded settings making social distancing nearly impossible and with inadequate hygiene facilities and lack of access to health services. IDPs overcrowded living conditions are also known to increase exposure to GBV, particularly for women and girls as a result of sharing communal living, cooking, and WASH facilities since the average living space per person is 1.3m2. Where water availability for sanitation is often well below the Sphere standard will be of primary concern to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

These will be achieved using well-established IR and OWDA experiences with local partners and the beneficiary communities.</narrative>
