   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash-Based Emergency Food Assistance to shock-affected families in Waygal and Wama Districts of Nuristan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the recent IPC analysis result, 94,903 people (45% of the population in Nuristan will be in IPC Phase 3 amp 4 (emergency and crises) and will experience acute food insecurity through the winter season. As per the result of the 2020 Seasonal Food Security Assessment (SFSA) shows 52% of the population in borderline FCS and 32.9% in poor FCS. On top of this, 95% of the households reported experiencing a recent shock. The major shocks faced by respondents were loss of employment, reduced income followed by severe sickness or death of breadwinner (due to COVID-19) together with a huge increase in food prices.


In line with the priorities of the 6th RA 2020, AWRO will provide cash for food assistance to 1,786 HHs in Wama and Waygal districts with 4 half rations for a total of US$180 per household. This amount is based on the FSAC endorsed standard package (calculated based on 2,100 kcal/person/day food needs of an average size family and the market price of food items). Cash will be distributed in two installments.


1. Waygal district
 914 multiple shock-affected Families (1376 Men, 1728 Women,  1556 Boys and 1740 Girls) 
Will receive US$ 180 for four months food assistance (Half package of FSAC Standard food basket of family (90 US$/month x 2 = US$ 180).
2. Wama district
871 multiple Shock-affected Families (1311 Men, 1628 Women, 1503 Boys and 1658 Girls) 
Will receive US$ 180 for four months food assistance (Half package of FSAC Standard food basket of family (90 US$/month x 2= US$ 180).

For this assignment, AWRO will use the local Tellers&#x2019; services/Money Service Providers (Hawala/MPS) system based on CVWG response criteria as there are Money Service Providers available to provide services for cash transmission, available in Nuristan province. There are two banks available in the province (1 governmental, 1 private), but the MSPs are more available and easy-to-access for the target beneficiaries as there are over 15 MSP shops available in there. Except the Fridays which are official holiday, the money service providers are available throughout the week. The availability of Money Services Providers MSPs (Local Hawala) is ensured and physically checked. In order to effectively avoid currency loss, it&#x2019;s important to provide market based cash response in AFN currency as the target people are not accustomed to USD currency as all transactions are carried out in AFN currency throughout the province.

AWRO will establish participant selection and distribution committees including representatives from local communities (e.g. CDC and DDA heads), government (e.g. ANDMA and DoRR) and AWRO. Participants will be selected according to FSAC vulnerability criteria to ensure the most acutely in need are targeted, including IDPs, women-headed households and households with a large number of dependent children.

Taking account of the &#x201C;Do No Harm&#x201D; policy this assignment will not negatively affect the market, prices or the transactions, instead, it would be an added value and multiplier to inject cash into the market.

Besides the cash distribution, community mobilizers will conduct awareness training on COVID-19, and how to potentially mitigate Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in the families, including a focus on child rights. Awareness-raising will be conducted in all villages in separate male/female groups, information leaflets will be distributed to ensure ongoing access to information. 

Covid-19 and Protection awareness-raising sessions also take place at the distribution site. Key people of each village participate in community dialogues in order to discuss protection issues and information will be shared about other services available within the area to enable women to potentially get in touch with support services. This will however continue to be a challenge due to the remoteness and a small number of health facilities available.</narrative>
