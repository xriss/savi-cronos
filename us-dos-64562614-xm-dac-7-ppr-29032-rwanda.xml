   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rwanda 2021 Q1 Country update: In Rwanda, planting for the 2021A season concluded in October 2020, with harvest being conducted in January - February 2021. Enrollment for the 2021B season occurred in October/November 2020. For the latter season, we enrolled farmers entirely through a mobile phone-based system &#x2014; developed in response to COVID-19 movement restrictions. This year, we are gearing up to start the testing of a new repayment app through field officer tablets. One Acre Fund Rwanda&#x2019;s clients are currently harvesting crops grown in the second planting season of the year (2021B) as field staff continues to collect loan repayments.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2021, we are on track to achieve an SROI of 9.5 in Rwanda, meaning that every $1 donated will generate $9.5 in farmer impact. This year, we expect to maintain a repayment rate of 89.4%, while increasing sustainability to 81.8% through cost-cutting measures like increasing the number of farmers served by each field officer from 251 in 2020 to 331 in 2021. In addition, as we enroll more farmers, indirect costs per farmer will continue to decrease through economies of scale.</narrative>

Our strong alignment with the Rwandan government&apos;s national priorities continues to boost our long-term goal of reaching every farming household country-wide through our core program or partnerships. In 2020, this work reached over 2.8 million farmer touchpoints (individual project interactions) in addition to our core program. Projects sought to catalyze local hybrid seed production, improve agricultural extension services, and expand the country&apos;s rural retail sector.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We reached 631,400 farm families in Rwanda through our core program in 2020, expanding by an encouraging 67%. Key to this breakthrough growth included tech solutions for enabling operations in the COVID-19 context &#x2014; in particular, nationwide scale-up of USSD enrollment has allowed client signup and product ordering without face-to-face contact with our staff. Another key factor in our expansion this year was robust government support; we were encouraged by the government to expand to reach all of Rwanda&#x2019;s agricultural districts where we had not yet established operations. This invitation reflects the government&#x2019;s deep trust in our program and our strong support for government priorities. Our program now has very high program penetration in most areas of the country (we estimate that about 40% of all smallholder farmers in Rwanda are enrolled in our core program), and farmers typically cycle in and out of the program. There are some areas in which it is very difficult to find comparison farmers who have not been in the program, and those who have not might have picked up farming practices from nearby participating farmers. While all of this represents a measurement challenge, we view this &#x201C;whole market&#x201D; penetration overall as great news for farmers nationwide. With this type of reach, our work has the potential to achieve truly transformative impact on Rwanda&apos;s agriculture sector.</narrative>
