   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing food security and sustainable livelihood support to IDPs, returnees and most vulnerable host community households in crisis affected Wau County, South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This food security and livelihood project is a dual sub-sector (crop, vegetable gardening and fisheries) response which will run for 12 months from May 2020 &#x2013; April 2021. The main focus of this project will be to alleviate the immediate short-term food insecurity outcomes of the target households while contributing to protecting livelihoods of at-risk food insecure populations in Besselia payams of Wau County, South Sudan reaching 4800hh to sustainably produce and access nutritious food food. This will be achieved through improving agricultural production and fishery activities. The project directly targets 4800 vulnerable households of primarily IDPs (20%), returnees (20%) and host community (60%). The beneficiaries will be targeted basing on a vulnerability matrix tool to be agreed on with the stakeholders and community. 
This project will focus mainly on the following key activities: 1) provision of climate smart fast maturing crop and vegetable seeds which will improve nutritious food production) Special attention will be given to the marginalized people like persons with disability, the elderly, chronically ill, orphans, girls and women to make sure they are not left out in the project) 2) provision of fishing kits which will enable them to immediately engage in fishing activities for household consumption that will contribute to improved nutrition, household income and also better their livelihoods through diversification) 3) basic agronomic training and extension support, through community-based extension workers that will entail conservation of natural resources, harvest and post-harvest losses reduction along production, distribution and consumption channels and also raising awareness about food systems 

This project will be implemented in two phases phase one will be main season agricultural production (May to August) where inputs crop, vegetable seeds and tools and fishing kits will be distributed to target 4800 hh who will as well receive agricultural production training. The second phase will be for dry season (November 2020 to February 2021) where only fast maturing vegetable seeds and fishing gears will be distributed to 4800hh as well. During the implementation period, SPEDP will ensure adherence to the recent COVID-19 pandemic safety guidelines with some awareness messaging during key project activities implementation time
SPEDP will also use a community based participatory approach where beneficiary identification and registration process will involve community members.

Project management committees will be established with at least 50% female representation and will take an active role in the beneficiary selection, monitoring implementation and also handling complaints and feedback mechanisms (CFM) and monitoring of the project, this CFM will be accessible by both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. 
SPEDP will group beneficiaries into 30 members per group and from the group identify a Lead Farmer who will receive training from SPEDP extension workers. The total number of Lead farmers will be 160 (88 female, 72 male). A cascading model will be adopted where Lead Farmers will in turn train fellow group members on basic agronomics. Besides, more 32% of the beneficiaries (1536 of which 845 will be female and 691 male) will be trained as well in both crop and vegetable gardening and improved fishing methods. Therefore this project will contribute towards protecting vulnerable populations affected by the hunger crisis, malnutrition and destitution and will support them to improve food production by providing them with the skills, crop and vegetable and fishing kits as well as tools, the nutritional benefits of fish consumption have a positive link to increased food security and decreased poverty rates within this proposed payam. SPEDP will strive to integrate with other projects like health, WASH and nutrition through passive referrals and also establishment of demonstration plots at nutrition sites.</narrative>
