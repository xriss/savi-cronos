   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project endeavors to implement integrated activities in the humanitarian field in western rural of Aleppo province. This intervention will make contribution towards addressing critical food insecurity, instability and develop the essential household&#x2019;s livelihood assets through supporting the wheat value chain, access to agriculture, livestock breeders, bakeries, and IDPs/returnees. The project includes implementation of the main activities:
1. Supplementing the wheat support chain, as MASRRAT through its ongoing project is supporting 480 wheat farmers beneficiaries in Aleppo countryside, the project is funded by OCHA and will end in the July when the harvest is over, and through this intervention, it is planned to support the wheat chain by purchasing 500 kg of wheat from each beneficiary (based on specific criteria) and will be milled, as flour and bran. So, we will have approximately 80% flour equivalent to 192 tons and about 20% bran equivalent to 48-tons in order to:

A. Support the bakeries by wheat flour to produce 211.2 tons of bread to distribute it for free to 2400 families in camps and returnees for two consecutive months. MASRRAT will contract with four bakeries to increase the community participation and reduce work pressure so they do not exceed the daily production capacity.
B. As for the 48-tons of wheat bran, we will support 240 livestock breeders by distributing of 200 kg of bran for each beneficiary. Beneficiaries of livestock breeders will be the families who have (1-10 livestock) and not supported. In addition, training will be provided to livestock breeders on breeding of animals and products.

2. Improving access to agriculture by distributing of agricultural inputs for 600 beneficiaries. Every beneficiary will receive 250 kg of wheat seeds, 150 kg of composed fertilizer, 200 kg of Azote fertilizer, 1 liter of Herbicide,1 liter of Insecticide, one fuel voucher for irrigation 50 $ and harvesting costs 50 $. Moreover, the support will include provision of three technical training sessions about GAP. The beneficiaries of wheat activity will be from the local community and IDPs who settled for a while, own or renting land between 7 to10 donums suitable for wheat, as well as the farmers who meet the selection criteria. All the agricultural inputs will be purchases inside Syria in order to support the local markets.

This project will support 12951 beneficiaries affected by the Syrian crisis (3229 men, 2867 women, 3334 boys and 3521 girls) by promoting their accessibility to the humanitarian assistance significantly. All the people in the targeted villages and markets will benefit directly/indirectly from the project where the wheat and livestock production will be available in the markets at good prices. Furthermore, this intervention will improve the capacity of 2400 IDPs and returnees (men, women, children pregnant, elderly and disabled) who returned to their areas in Atareb sub-district in Aleppo and don&#x2019;t able to get sufficient quantities of bread because of poverty or inability due to lack of enough bakeries or bread distribution points. The project is designed with consideration to the cluster and WHO recommendation on prevention and mitigation measures related to COVID-19 especially during the distribution of support and conducting trainings. In addition, protection cluster recommendations were taken into consideration, wherein all the population in the targeted locations will benefit from MASRRAT protection Centers in Aleppo, in the event of any GBV referral cases.
