  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps (IMC) is a US-registered independent affiliate organization of International Medical Corps UK (IMC UK), with which IMC UK shares the same name and charitable objectives and mission. IMC UK and IMC work together to deliver assistance programs in an accountable and effective manner in pursuit of their commonly-held charitable objectives. IMC UK will engage IMC to implement its programs in the field, with IMC UK oversight, according to the terms and conditions of the agreement that results from this proposal and the terms of the parties&#x2019; administrative service agreement. Together with IMC Croatia, IMC provides administrative and operational support to IMC UK and to the programs on the ground, including but not limited to financial management, banking and cash management, procurement management/international procurements and logistics.


In consideration of the AHF 5th Reserve Allocation 2020, International Medical Corps (IMC) proposes to provide life-saving health services to the conflict-affected and hard-to-reach communities in Paktika province. As per IMC&apos;s coordination with key stakeholders in the area and secondary information, currently, there are critical gaps in healthcare services, especially trauma care and PHC services, forcing the majority of these communities to travel long distances to seek these services, resulting in disabilities, morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, COVID-19 has further deteriorated the situation for these vulnerable, crisis-affected and hard-to-reach communities, who have little or no awareness about COVID-19. 


IMC has a strong presence and experience in the Paktika province as well as the expertise in the implementation of emergency health programs in similar contexts, IMC can leverage this capability and expertise to ensure the successful implementation of the proposed project. The interventions will take specific care to implement the program per the BPHS/EPHS guidelines and SPHERE standard, providing safe access for vulnerable groups, such as women and girls, to the services. 

Through this project, IMC will contribute to the Health Cluster/sectors objectives through the following activities:

1. Establishment of 2 FATPs in 2 hard-to-reach districts (Giyan and Dila) of Paktika province to stabilize injured and refer to the nearest hospital for advanced care based on need 
2. To provide a timely and standard referral, IMC will provide 2 Ambulances (one at each FATP) equipped and supplied with all necessary items to provide first -aid and basic life support.
3. Training of newly recruited nurses on BLS to provide quality trauma care services 
4. Provision of medical supplies, medical equipment and medicines to the newly established FATPs and SHCs based on MOPH / WHO standard essential list
5. Establishment of two Health Sub-Centers (HSCs) in Gomal district to provide emergency primary health care including antenatal care services
6. Establish and operate Tele-health center at the Sharan Provincial hospital (PH) to provide awareness and RCCE on COVID-19
7. Training and mobilization of Community Health Workers (CHWs) to conduct awareness and community-based surveillance for COVID-19

IMC will implement the project in close coordination with Health Cluster, Paktika PHD, MoPH, BPHS/EPHS implementing organization and the communities at the national and local levels.</narrative>
