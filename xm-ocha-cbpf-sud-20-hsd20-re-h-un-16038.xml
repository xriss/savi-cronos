   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to be ready for any worst-case scenario in case of a COVID-19 outbreak in the refugee populated camps in Kassala and Kosti. 

The objective is to support establishment of 11 number of isolation facilities in/ or around refugee camps that can accommodate 27,023 refugees with mild to medium COVID-19 symptoms in White Nile State and Kassala. UNHCR will support in the procurement of PPE, medical equipment, medical supplies for the functioning of the isolation centers. In addition, UNHCR will disseminate 142,000 IEC materials to refugees in the targeted locations. 

In the worst-case scenario of community transmission in Sudan, refugees would not be spared. Although all refugee locations might eventually be affected, not all locations would be affected at the same time and the number of affected locations would increase with time.

1.	Outbreak of COVID-19 in refugee camp or settlement &#x2013; status quo remains (less likely): 
A case or cluster of cases is identified and health services are able to react and transfer the suspect/confirmed cases into isolation outside the camp. The cases receive specialised care in isolation facilities outside camps, which presumes good isolation capacity and support services at the isolation facility, including for example wet feeding for all isolated individuals. The remaining camp population remain on-site, continue to be able to access full services and move freely outside of curfew hours. Regular refugee assistance services continue in the camp with COVID preventive measures already in place.  

2.	Outbreak of COVID-19 in refugee camp or settlement &#x2013; entire camp quarantined (most likely):
A case or cluster of cases is identified and triggers a lock-down and quarantine of the entire refugee camp by the authorities. The camp quarantine is put in place with the objective of preventing transmission to the host population. The suspect/ confirmed cases will not be isolated separately and remain inside the camp. Health care support to confirmed cases will have to be provided within the quarantined camp area, which may (or not) include the present health centre. COVID-19 will spread rapidly among the entire camp population, with possible larger numbers of cases requiring intensive care as per modelling. Regular assistance services at the camp will be disrupted due to quarantine measures, and limited ability of assistance providers to enter and leave the camp. Assistance providers in all sectors will have to develop alternative delivery modalities to ensure operations continuity, some services entirely close down. 

3.	Outbreak of COVID-19 in refugee camp or settlement &#x2013; refugees disperse and try to leave to country of origin (least likely):
The baseline is scenario 1. However, the first suspect COVID-19 cases trigger a wave of departure from the refugee camp. Refugees try to either relocate to the hosting community or to travel to the nearest border point towards their country of origin. Many will become stranded in isolation in ad-hoc isolation / detention facilities, including at the border. COVID-19 outbreaks may occur at these ad-hoc isolation/detention facilities. There will be a call for humanitarian assistance services, and a COVID-19 medical response, at the ad-hoc isolation</narrative>
