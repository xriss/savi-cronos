   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Health, WASH  Protection response for Ethiopian Refugee in Gadaref state</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This 8 month project will provide urgent health, WASH and protection support to Ethiopian refugees in Gadarif state. The sudden influx of refugees into East Sudan has placed a significant strain on the health system in Kassala and Gedaref states. New health facilities are urgently needed to meet the needs of Ethiopian refugees currently entering the region. Many  refugees are reported to be in poor health as result of fleeing from conflict in the Tigray region. Additionally, many are reported to have a range of underlying health conditions which require medical attention. There is an urgent need to provide nutrition and food assistance to the refugees arriving in Kassala and Gedarif. Many of the arriving refugees are poorly nourished and a number of cases of Severely Acute Malnourishment (SAM) have been recorded. 
Proposed Health activities:

The proposed activities are: 
	Establish, staff, and run a 24-hour Health Clinic in Tunaydbah refugee camp

	Provide health screenings and triages
	Provide health/nutrition screening on arrival, prior to relation to camps, including temperature and symptom checks related to COVID-19. 
	Secure ambulance on standby for emergency referrals 
	Psychological/mental health support for trauma and sexual violence
	COVID-19 risk communication and sensitisation
	Nutrition support to under-five children

At the reception points and camps under construction / rehabilitation, there is an urgent need for the provision of basic WASH services for the arriving refugees. Many of the sites lack sufficient clean water supplies to cater for the needs of the refugees. Most of the households are arriving with only basic possessions and lack suitable water collection / storage containers to meet their daily needs. At the reception points and camps, there is also a lack of latrines and most of the refugees are practicing open defection which presents a serious hygiene risk. Waste collection services are also non-existent and as the refugee population grows is likely to become a significant concern.  ARC plans a series of WASH interventions aimed at providing emergency support to Ethiopians refugees located at Tendebah camp. A number of WASH activities are planned focused on the provision of safe potable water. Critically, ARC will rehabilitate and upgrade the water supply system at Tendebah camp to enable the site to host refugees who will be settled there. We also plan to construct latrines in the camp for the refugees and conduct a series of clean and hygiene promotion activities. 

Emergency situations, such as the one unfolding in Kassala and Gedarif, present a number of protection risks for those seeking refuge from conflict in their home country. A number of urgent protection needs have been identified. Children represent one of the most vulnerable groups and there is a need for specific protection activities which respond to their needs especially in terms of the provision of safe spaces in which they can learn and play. The protection of women from sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) has also been recognized as an important consideration in the refugee response.

The proposed activities are: 
	Ensure mainstreaming of the Protection, Gender and Inclusion Minimum Protection Standards in emergencies in all sectors including WASH, Health amp Nutrition 
	Briefings to all staff involved in the response on Prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, child safeguarding and code of conduct.
	Disseminate messages on preventing and responding to SGBV in all community outreach activities in Wash and health
	Child protection, including identification of UASC and women&apos;s centers</narrative>
