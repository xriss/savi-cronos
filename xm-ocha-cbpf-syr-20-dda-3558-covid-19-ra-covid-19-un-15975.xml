   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nine years of conflict in Syria have created one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time. About 5.6 million Syrians are refugees, and another 6.2 million people are internally displaced. An estimated 12 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance. At least half of the people affected by the Syria crisis are children. Hundreds of healthcare centers and hospitals, schools and utilities are damaged or destroyed. Families are struggling to survive. Having just endured a harsh winter, they now face the threat of COVID-19, a global pandemic that poses significant risk to vulnerable communities across the world. Altogether, the Syria crisis can feel overwhelming. In fact, it is a &#x201C;crisis within crisis&#x201D;.
As of April 21, 2020, there have been 42 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Syrian Arab Republic, including three deaths. Although the number is still low compared to neighboring countries, predictions are it will grow significantly unless immediate and targeted actions are taken by the Government of Syria and humanitarian actors to limit and prevent further spread of COVID-19 in Syria. Half the infections are community transmitted indicating the presence of potentially high number of local coronavirus clusters. Based on the current epidemiological situation in the region, and the capacity of the healthcare system, WHO considers the overall risk for Syria to be very high. Immediate and coordinated actions are needed to prevent a socio-economic and public health catastrophe.

In response to the COVID-19 Epidemic and the urgent needs to prevent the spread of the infection in Syria, the project targets the governorates of Daraa, Deir Ezzor and Lattakia with the rehabilitation of Saida Health Center in Daraa Governorate, Al-Hamidiya Health Center in Deir Ezzor City and the Department of the Communicable Diseases in the Lattakia  National Hospital. The locations identified in coordination with health sector and the priorities of MoH. The targeted interventions will be implemented through direct contracts with the private sector.
The main targeted cities and communities shall serve a population of around 73,000 Including thousands of IDPs scattered across several governorates.

The health services in the targeted areas are secured to a minimum and one of the main reasons is the obvious deficit in the number of the functional health facilities which need an immediate intervention to make them functional and ready to facilitate the cooperative efforts made to stop the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.
The level of damage of the targeted health facilities is minor and a light rehabilitation will be enough to cover the need and put the health facilities in service. 
The rehabilitation works will include civil and architecture works, sanitary works, electrical works, mechanical works, roof waterproofing and the maintenance of the water and sewage networks inside the targeted health facilities limits.
The selection criteria of the targeted health facilities are:
-	The results of pre-assessment report
-	The selected health facilities are in line with UNDP, WHO and local authorities&apos; priorities
-	The selected health facilities are in or near a potential outbreak hotspot &#x2013; population density and vulnerability due to frequent exposure etc.,
-	The selected health facilities are partially damaged and the percentage of damaged doesn&apos;t exceed 20%.
-	The selected health facilities are accessible
-	The selected health facilities are can be rehabilitated within an execution period of no more than 6 months</narrative>
