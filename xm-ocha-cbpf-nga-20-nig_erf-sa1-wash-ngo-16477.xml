  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gujba LGA which has been under-served in WASH needs, including insufficient water infrastructure to meet the demands of its population. It has also been under the threat of water borne diseases. Taimako-CDI as a frontline responder organization has shown that there is a low knowledge of basic hygiene standards and open defecation is still being practiced. Moreover, with distance as a major barrier to accessing these water sources, women who are often goes to fetch water for their households are exposed to protection risks. However, All approaches will be strategise and embrace inclusiveness to prevent discrimination, abuse, exploitation or violence.

This project is part of the 2020 humanitarian response plan on with HRP Project code: HNGA20WSHC19-166357-1, it is designed to address the critical WASH need for the people affected by humanitarian emergencies in 5 wards of katarko, Buni-yadi, Buni-gari, Gujba-gari and Goniri in Gujba LGA of Yobe state through provision of access to disability inclusive safe and sufficient water, and hygiene services. The project is targeting IDPs and host communities who are at risk of Covid-19 pandemic. The project will address the current Covid-19 pandemic issue regarding the WASH facilities in the targeted locations as well through strengthening the existing effort, particularly in awareness raising, hand washing practicing, social distancing. In order to mitigate the spread of covid-19 among vulnerable groups in the targeted locations, the project will establish disability inclusive hand-washing points with adequate provision of alcohol-based hand sanitizers at strategic places to enable active involvement of the persons with disability. The project will use the WASH sector strategies and guidelines in all stages of implementation.

This project aims to reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from waterborne diseases by increasing access to safe water and better hygiene practices among communities most affected by the current conflict, communities most affected by disease outbreaks such as cholera, communities with high levels of malnutrition and food insecurity.  TCDI will conduct hygiene promotion activities to support effective behavior change.

Without water, there cannot be enough high quality food and people cannot lead healthy lives without standard food and water hygiene. Project team will coordinate with food security sector to ensure high quality delivery of project activities in line with sectoral objectives and sphere standards. Research has found that better access to water reduces malnourishment especially in development settings such as that of the targeted communities of Gujba LGA.
With improved access to quality water and hygiene services, households in targeted communities will be able to establish and maintain micro gardens where vegetables and basic nutritional household crops could be cultivated, even in dry seasons. This will increase community livelihoods and household nutritional intake.  Children, persons with disabilities and other community members will therefore be less prone to diseases and infections related to water and hygiene.</narrative>
