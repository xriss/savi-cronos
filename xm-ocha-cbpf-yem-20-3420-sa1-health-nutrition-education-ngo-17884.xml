Direct delivery of basic and essential services2. Supporting the selected facilities (HFs and schools) by the provision of operational costs, health hazard allowances, training etc 3. Supporting community-based interventions.

in November 2020, TYF conducted a multisectoral in-depth need assessment in Maqbanah district in both DFA and IRG geographical sides, where 87.7% of all households are unable to meet their basic needs in one or more sectors and/or are relying on negative, unsustainable coping mechanisms to meet these needs. Additionally, the most common gaps were in health, Food insecurity amp livelihood and WASH. Under this proposal. TYF aims to reach 34,964 direct beneficiaries including 909 IDPs (Annex1).

In terms of health interventions: the project will provide life-saving basic and essential quality services including treatment of communicable and non-communicable diseases and improve the surveillance system. The total expected direct beneficiaries with health services will be  29,222 individuals including 564 IDPs.

In terms of nutrition interventions, the project will help in removing the barriers that prevent families from using community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) services to contribute to reducing the prevalence of malnutrition among children and pregnant lactating women (PLW). The total expected direct nutrition beneficiaries will be 4,106 individuals including 246 IDPs.

In terms of Education, the project aims to support 7079 students (190 IDPs, 6889 Host). To achieve this goal TYF will supporting10 targeted schools and establish five semi-structured temporary learning classrooms (TLCs) within those targeted schools. 30 school volunteer teachers will be received incentives, and 32 fixed teachers will be trained in Education in Emergency (EiE). Additionally, 8 latrines in 2 targeted schools will be constructed, in addition, to support the minor sanitary rehabilitations. Total expected direct education beneficiaries will be 1,638 individuals including 428 IDPs.

An integrated activity approach (Health, Nutrition amp education) will be used, especially in Almalahitah subdistrict where the targeted school (AlGilani) and the targeted Alrebat HC is located within the same subdistrict.
