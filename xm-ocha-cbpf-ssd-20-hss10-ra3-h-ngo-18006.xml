   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Integrated Emergency Lifesaving Health Services for people in acute humanitarian needs in Gumuruk and Lekuangole Payams of Pibor County in Jonglei State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNH is a dual mandated organization that provides development and emergency response. Based on our experience in emergency response, developed this project targeting Gumuruk and Lekuangole following consultative meetings with the State Ministry of Health, County Health Department, local authority, affected persons including elderly amp persons with disability.
The main trigger for development of this proposal is the December 2020 IPC result which indicated that about 20% of the population in Pibor is in IPC 5 which is Catastrophe. For the past two consecutive years, Gumuruk and Lekunagole experienced intense flooding and cyclical waves of intercommunal violence. 
IRNA assessment conducted in September 2020 shows that about 25,959 and 29,167 people of Lekuangole and Gumuruk respectively were affected following the intercommunal violence and flooding. 
Gumuruk and Lekaungole has only 1 mobile unit each, not able to meet the health needs of the people who are in acute humanitarian needs. No CEmONC services, limited BEmONC services, no inpatient facility, most of the affected populations have no access to lifesaving health care. Measles transmission continued despite the reactive campaign.
UNH proposed to intervene through provision of emergency and basic lifesaving health services for people who are in acute humanitarian needs with aim to mitigate the risk of food insecurity and negative consequences of COVID-19. Will do this through deployment of 4 mobile units (2 each in Gumuruk and Lekuangole) and strengthening 2 PHCCs (1 in each Payam) through staffing and provision of medical supplies and equipment. The mobile units and the PHCCs will provide packages ranging from screening, essential health care, treatment, referral, promotive and preventive services/risk communication and surveillance/EWARN. The activities implemented under these packages included but not limited to: 
	Conduct rapid test for malaria with RDT, diagnose and provide treatment for uncomplicated malaria, respiratory tract infection and diarrhoea cases.
	Provide Basic Obstetric and Neonatal Care (BeMONC) services at the facilities to ensure institution deliveries and support community deliveries.
	Conduct community mobilization to create demand for EPI and provide routine immunization.
	Identify and manage SAM children with medical complications.
	Provide curative OPD consultation. 
	Conduct 3 days training for 20 health workers from Gumuruk and Lekuangole PHCCs on BEmONC. 
	Conduct training for 56 health workers on disease surveillance and outbreak response including COVID-19 infection prevention and control and IMCI/EWARS/common illnesses, case management guidelines and protocol.
	Provision of GBV and MHPS services.
	Ensure liaison and coordination with national, county health authorities.
	Surveillance, Early warning and Response for Disease Outbreak detection and management
	Sample collection and testing for diseases that are of epidemic potential
The proposed activities are in line with the reserved strategy and health cluster strategies. To implement these activities, UNH needs 400,000.00 USD to implement the project for 6 months, February 24 to August 23, 2021. With these resources, UNH will reach 50,811 beneficiaries 40,650 returnees (Men 9,948, women 11,191 boys 9,349 and girls 10,162) IDPs 2,540 (men 604 women 717, boys 584 and girls 635) host communities 7,621 (men 1,802, women 2,161, boys 1,753 and girls 1,905). People with disability will be reached through mobile clinics and about 138 targeted (Men 40, women 35, boys 33, girls 30).
UNH will work with other health partners, WASH, FSL and Protection partners to ensure synergies and value for money, will engage the CHD and development health partner LiveWell to take over at the end of the project to ensure sustainability.</narrative>
