      <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) In 2012, there were approximately 115 non-incineration HCW technologies installed throughout Africa. In the project countries, 3 working hydroclaves have been installed in Ghana (April 2014). Affordable non-incineration technologies are not available to African HCFs
2) UPOPs baseline: Ghana: 19.8 g-TEQ/yr (pre-selected hospitals) Mercury baseline: Ghana: 8.2 kg/yr (pre-selected hospitals)

3) The regulatory, policy framework not current, national implementation plan not operational and No standard exist in medical waste management Ghana.
4) Evaluation criteria and allocation of technologies among project countries not in place.  Some knowledge on Mercury and UPOPs releases from the health sector built during the PPG phase. 

5) In each of the project countries the baseline pertaining to the HCWM policy and regulatory framework is different. For Ghana the situation is summarized on page 20 in the section &#x201C;National Policy regulatory and legal Framework on HCWM in Ghana&#x201D; Draft National Action Plans for project implementation available.  Pre-selection of HCFs has already taken place.
6) Three (3) BAT in 3 pre-selected HCFs and none (0) BEP in place at most of the model HCFs. No recycling programmes in place at any of the HCFs. No storage sites for Mercury or Medical devices containing Mercury available in any of the project countries. In Ghana, some project HCFs already uses some Mercury-free medical devices, but none of the pre-selected HCFs is Mercury-free. In Ghana, training programme for waste management exists, but training programmes for HCWM need to be established/improved</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	5 JSD 250l autoclaves were installed in 3 health care facilities (two for Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, two for Eastern Regional Hospital and one for Tebgi Health Center). The provision of the autoclave treatment technologies and the training provided to health care staff (350 people) in the 5 pilot facilities has contributed to building national capacity to implement best techniques in the management of healthcare waste to eliminate the emission of Unintended Persistent Organic Pollutants like dioxins and furans into the environment, as required by the Stockholm Convention.  In the long run, it will contribute to improvement in healthcare delivery which will reduce the exposure to infections on patients, health staff and nearby communities.


2.	A national modular course for health care waste management has been established at the Accra School of Hygiene. The objective is to create a system to provide capacity building opportunities for healthcare waste managers and practitioners. 26 trainees ranging from health care workers, environmental health officers and consultants from civil society were trained in 2018 to contribute to already existing capacity in health facilities to manage healthcare waste in an environmentally sound manner.


3.	The Project Mid-Term Evaluation was conducted. Its findings are being taken into consideration in the planning of the second phase of the project, starting in 2020.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) Directors of the PPME, Legal Unit and the Chief Director of Ministry of Health were engaged to have a final review of the policy and guidelines. This was followed by a final review by the Minister for Health who reviewed and passed the documents for printing.Prior to this, key directors in GHS, ESPA, MESTI and EPA reviewed and shared final inputs in the policy and guidelines for finalization.  
2&amp;3) WHO has produced dummy copies for final review. Launching and dissemination of revised policy and guidelines is planned for 2020. 

4)There is little or no presence of recyclers of plastics in the project areas. So far, only one scrap dealer has expressed willingness to explore the possibilities of recycling the sharp waste generated from the health facilities. 
5)Collaborated with GHS and MoH to construct the facility. However, this discussion could not progress due to institutional bottlenecks at EPA (The national focal point on mercury expected to provide technical guidance). Discussion ongoing to have a solution in 2020 through the intervention of UNDP. 

6) Procurement process being done by UNDP was uncompleted as at the end of the year. This process is expected to be completed in the first part of 2020. 
7)3 new HCF facilities selected for the second phase of the project, namely: Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Dua Yaw Nkwanta St. John of God Hospital and the Greater Accra Regional Hospital. They will be provided with logistics and capacity building to improve healthcare waste management in their facilities.  Only Dua Yaw Nkwanta St. John of God Hospital however will receive an autoclave in January 2020. 
8) Draft MoUs are being discussed between the Phase 1 facilities and new facilities identified in the operation area. MOUs expected to be signed in 2020 to initiate operation. Number of new facilities identified for each of the model facilities yet to be confirmed after MOU signing. 
9) Procurement processes still ongoing. hence exchange of additional mercury free devices programme yet to be implemented. Good to note that this process has been conducted between UNDP/MOH/GHS to ensure that the national systems fully participate in this process to enhance ownership and learning.In addition to this a draft national strategy for mercury phaseout in the health sector has been developed to provide strategic direction on mercury phaseout activities towards the 2025 deadline under the Minamata Convention. Model facilities of the project have also been supported to develop an exit strategy which include a plan for mercury phaseout in their health facilities. Additional funding has been approved through the Minamata SIP to support additional phaseout programmes in 2020.   
10) -a. This training could not take place due to the delay in the installation of the autoclave equipment at Dua Yaw Nkwanta Hospital. The technicians from the suppliers are expected to deliver this training in 2020. 
-b.  Four quarterly trainings was conducted in all model facilities on HCWM and data management. This has contributed to increased segregation and management of HCWM data for planning. 
-c. One modular course training was organised in Ho School of Hygiene. A total of 26 participants were trained through the Modular short course on HCWM. This is to increase the availability of technical experts at the national level to lead the mainstreaming of HCWM at various levels.
-d. Curriculum review on-going in collaboration with Ministry of Health and UBORA Institute. It is expected to be completed in January 2020.  
11) Documentation of lessons learnt and best practices on-going. One impact story has been drafted and being reviewed. 
The project facilitated a learning visit from personnel from Uganda MOH, to learn about HCWM systems being established here in Ghana for replication in Uganda. 
12) Two case studies have been developed and shared widely to stakeholders. One of these abstracts was accepted by the Global Green and Health Hospitals, culminating in Ghana&#x2019;s participation in the GGHH regional conference in
