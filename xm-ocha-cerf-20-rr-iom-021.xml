by Floods and Landslides in Rwanda</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention aims at saving lives and alleviating the suffering of the populations affected by floods and landslides in Rwanda and particularly assisting the victims of landslides with life-saving support as avoiding the actual poor humanitarian situation to further deteriorate. The output of the project is to ensure that the most vulnerable displaced households are provided with adequate emergency shelter assistance, this will be done through six activities; identification of the beneficiaries;  Procurement of shelter materials; Transportation of shelter materials;  briefing on protection, GBV and COVID-19 for the distribution team; distribution of emergency shelter materials; monitoring and evaluation.  Approximately 1,765 households will be supported through the provision of iron sheets and other shelter materials to rehabilitate their houses or to construct emergency shelters.  Each household will receive iron sheets, nails, cement, and galvanized wire as per national standards and recommendations, based on the conducted humanitarian situation and needs assessment in the identified areas. This will enable families to quickly return to their homes or to relocate to semi-permanent emergency shelters and address overcrowding problems that have been reported in temporary shelter sites and by host families. These interventions will be conducted on demarked safe land as mapped by the district authorities, excluding all high-risk zones, to ensure that the affected population is not put at risk again during the upcoming rain season. This will ease health risks posed by overcrowding, in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic. This intervention will also allow displaced families living in schools to return home and schools to reopen in September 2020, as per government instructions.</narrative>
