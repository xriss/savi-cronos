  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Niger registered its first case of Covid-19 on 19 March 2020 and since then the number of cases has only increased and as of April 14, 2019, 570 cases have been declared positive for covid-19 of which 90 patients were cured and 14 died.
This situation is most worrying because of the pre-existing factors that increase the vulnerability of the population to the pandemic and will make it very difficult for the Government to carry out its response activities to Covid-19. Among these factors are the following: Epidemic meningitis during this dry season, voluntary deprivation of food during Ramadan, risk of propagation of Covid-19 because of Transhumant movements, Agricultural lean season and Water shortage throughout the country 

In this situation, the involvement of everyone remains the only way to overcome this epidemic.

This project will therefore support our partner Cadev Niger in its planned activities and its support to the initiatives taken by the government to respond to this epidemic. In the name of the Caritas Country Forum, CADEV will intervene in the activities of sensitization of the population, training of health workers on topics related to the prevention and management of nosocomial diseases in general and Covid-19 in particular, supply of personal protective equipment and other medical consumables, supply of water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH)  in the hospital environment, mainly in the 36 health facilities operated by the Catholic Church.

The project will be financed by all the organizations of the Caritas Country Forum (Niger).</narrative>
