   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COVID-19 Cash Assistance and Seasonal Shelter Support for Vulnerable Refugees and Jordanians</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Winter is a harsh season in Jordan. Low temperatures, rainfall, flooding, and snow threaten vulnerable populations who live in sub-standard shelters and are unable to make seasonal repairs and renovations to address damp and moldy walls, broken windows and doors, and large spaces that do not easily heat. While cash assistance is provided by UNHCR and other humanitarian actors in Jordan, a gap exists in interventions that invest in housing infrastructure and support increased security of tenure among vulnerable Syrian refugees and Jordanians. In response, this project aims to ensure improved living conditions, protection, and dignity for vulnerable refugee and Jordanian women, girls, boys, and men (WGBM) through seasonal shelter rehabilitation for those living in sub-standard shelters.


Upon conducting household assessments, IOCC has identified the need for home repairs and renovations to address urgent, seasonal needs among vulnerable households, particularly among households that include persons with disabilities (PWDs) and elderly at risk who have specific vulnerabilities that must be considered. The inability of these populations to secure shelter that meets their specific needs can have compounding negative impacts.


Building on assessment visits, IOCC will deploy outreach volunteers and Site Engineers to targeted areas of Amman, Irbid, and Mafraq to validate household vulnerability and conduct a technical assessment of potential beneficiaries&#x2019; shelters. IOCC will select 200 households (60 in Mafraq, 60 in Irbid, and 80 in Amman) for shelter rehabilitation through this project. Additionally, through a public tender process, IOCC will select contractors to conduct rehabilitation work.

IOCC Site Engineers will prepare bills of quantities (BoQs) and rehabilitation plans for each household. Additionally, IOCC will sign an agreement with each landlord and beneficiary that outlines responsibilities during and after the project. In this agreement, IOCC will ensure security of tenure and also negotiate rent reduction, depending on the level of investment in the shelter. Seasonal shelter upgrades will fall into four categories:
-	Level 1 &#x2013; 0 JOD to 499 JOD &#x2013; security of tenure for one year and no increase in rent
-	Level 2 &#x2013; 500 JOD to 899 JOD &#x2013; security of tenure for one year and rent reduction (at least 10%)
-	Level 3 &#x2013; investments between 900 JOD and 1,199 JOD &#x2013; security of tenure for 1 to 1.5 years and rent reduction (at least 20%)
-	Level 4 &#x2013; 1,200 JOD to 2,000 JOD &#x2013; security of tenure for 1 to 1.5 years and rent reduction (at least 30%).
In addition to consulting the Shelter Working Group&#x2019;s Technical Guidelines: Upgrading of Sub-standard Shelters, IOCC conducted a market analysis of prices for commonly needed items in rehabilitation to ensure the budget is appropriate.

Rehabilitation of shelters will focus first on seasonal needs, such as addressing thermal enhancements, including repair and insulation work that addresses issues of dampness and cold flood mitigation measures and reducing energy demand through efficiency measures. Additional work will be conducted on a case-by-case basis with a focus on safety and health concerns, as well as improved access in shelters for PWDs and elderly at risk.

Throughout the rehabilitation process, IOCC will conduct monitoring, particularly of contractors &#x2013; technically via Site Engineers, with beneficiaries and landlords via the IOCC Field Coordinator and MEAL Officer, and financially (including on-site) via the Finance Assistant. Site Engineers and the Field Coordinator will provide the final approval of rehabilitation work.

Toward the end of the project, the MEAL Officer will conduct surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) to gather information on the impact of activities. Additional follow-up will be conducted to ensure longer-term impacts of assistance and that no issues arise due to the project.</narrative>
