   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lifesaving intervention for multiple shock affected population at risk of hunger and malnutrition through cash for food distribution in Ghor Province, Afghanistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action&#x2019;s objective is to improve the food security status of multiple-shock-affected population and mitigate their risk to face malnutrition through cash for food assistance during the harsh winter and lean season in Dawlatyar and Lal Wa Sarjangal districts of Ghor Province.


Ghor Province is, according to all the assessments done in Afghanistan (HNO/HRP 2020, SFSA, IPC, FEWSNET) one of the most affected provinces in Afghanistan in terms of food insecurity. Mostly mountainous with limited arable land, Ghor has the highest deficit of wheat in the country. This province has the history of being classified in Emergency Phase (IPC Phase 4) during the past years. As of IPC September 2020 Analysis, Ghor province had 25% of its population in IPC 4 and 35% of its population in IPC 3.


COVID-19 also has had an impact on this already fragile province. Unusually high food prices linked to border closures and panic buying, caused by COVID-19, further exacerbated food access of households already living below the poverty line. Food commodity prices have increased to between 10% and 20% (IPC analysis April-November 2020 and WFP market monitoring 2019-2020). Moreover, it is expected that the food security situation in Ghor will further deteriorate with the arrival of the winter. As the harvest season is over, labor and job opportunities will decrease and the purchasing power of the local population will drastically drop. This along with the peak in food prices due to the heavy snowfall blocking the roads will severely limit the access to diversified food during the harsh months of winter. 

To address the emergency food insecurity situation in Ghor Province, AAH will deliver cash for food of the equivalent of 4 half rations for 17,000 individuals. These 17,000 individuals will be provided with unrestricted and unconditional cash. However, strong sensitization will be done by AAH teams before and during the distributions about food diversity to encourage households to spend their cash on diversified and highly nutritious food. This will prevent the households to engage in negative coping strategies that may result in loss of essential livelihood assets and therefore, increase their food consumption and dietary diversity. 

The expected impact of this cash-based intervention is that vulnerable households do not exhaust their harvest during the lean season and have uninterrupted access to diversified food during the upcoming harsh months of winter, avoiding a further deterioration of their food security status. 

This will be a six-month project, from 1st of December 2020 until 31st of May 2021, just before the start of the harvest in Ghor Province.</narrative>
