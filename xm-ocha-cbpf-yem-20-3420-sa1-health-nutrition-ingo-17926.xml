   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lifesaving integrated health and nutrition project in conflict affected priority districts of Aden and Taiz Governorate (Priority 2)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children (SC) proposes to provide lifesaving health and nutrition interventions for conflict affected communities in 4 districts (Dar-Saad, Ash Shamayatyn, At Taiziyah and Dimanat Khadir) in Aden and Taiz, targeting 165,431 direct beneficiaries, including: 157,788 host communities 7,643 IDPs  and 8,707 people with disabilities. Indirectly the project will reach 14,563 (1900 men, 12,664 women). An estimated 11,208 children U5 (5,633 boys, 5,576 girls) will be reached following national MNP supplementation protocol endorsed by MoPHP and nutrition cluster. The overall aim is the reduction of morbidity and mortality through enhancing access and coverage of life-saving primary health and nutrition treatment and prevention services - identified by both clusters in line with the cluster objective and the allocation strategy - in the targeted locations. This will be achieved through improving access to and utilization of life-saving primary and secondary health care services for IDP and host communities (children U5 and their families) and enhancing access and coverage of life-saving nutrition treatment and preventive services for IDP and host communities (boys, girls, PLW/G),in the conflict affected targeted districts. 
 
SC will provide operational and technical support to 24 identified primary health care facilities (HFs) to sustain health and nutrition services delivery and one mobile clinic in Darsaad. The key services package will include: primary health care in line with MSP package immunization support prevention of and preparedness for outbreaks &#x2013; especially for cholera and reproductive health care including delivery support. For Nutrition, the service package will include: treatment of severe and moderate acute malnutrition among U5 boys, girls and PLW/G provision of IYCF counselling support and Micronutrient Supplementation (based on Nutrition Cluster Guidance and National Protocols) in the HFs following an integrated CMAM and PHC approach to ensure continuum of health and nutrition care. SC will train and supervise community health volunteers (CHVs) for detection and referral of sick and acutely malnourished boys, girls and PLW/G to HFs and for promotion of appropriate IYCF, health seeking and hygiene practices. CHVs will promote health seeking behaviors, availability of nutrition and health services in facilities to create demand and increase utilization through active referrals. 

Operational support to HFs will include minor renovations and/or repairing solar systems, running costs for HFs, necessary medical and CMAM supplies, hazard allowances for health workers (HWs) and CHVs, and planning and support for the immunization of children U5 (capacity building of HWs, outreach activities for vaccination). Technical support will include technical trainings/re-trainings for the targeted HWs on MSP/IMCI, EmNOC, CMAM and IYCF, CHV modules on IYCF, and detection and referrals of acute malnutrition. Technical support will include regular supportive supervision and on-job coaching for HWs on quality standards, processes and protocols of IMCI, RH, CMAM, IYCF services provision. CHVs will be closely supported by trained community mobilization who will advise/coach them to provide improved quality of messaging and promotion of key behaviors for IYCF, health and hygiene through group/individual sessions.

SC consulted with Health and Nutrition sub-clusters and GHOs in Taiz and Aden to identify needs, selection of HFs aligning with the vulnerability, severity and prioritization analysis by National Clusters. The project directly contributes to HRP objective 1 and 5 and will significantly support in achieving Health, and Nutrition Cluster specific annual targets for 2021. All activities will be adapted to align with SC and Clusters/WHO guidance on COVID-19. SC will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation in targeted areas and ensure that communities and staff providing healthcare adhere to prevention protocols.</narrative>
