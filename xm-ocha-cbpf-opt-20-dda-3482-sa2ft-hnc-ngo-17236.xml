Moreover, 5,000 COVID-19 Isolation Kits that fit MOH&#x2019;s criteria and including female needs will be distributed to the targeted cases, each kit will include leaflet contains instructions on how amp when to use the contents of the kit. Knowing that coordination will be established with UNRWA when distributing the kits to avoid service duplication. 

From the other side amp as in-kind contribution from UHWC, psychological support services will be provided to the targeted cases over phone. 

Moreover, PPE will be distributed on the medical field staff to avoid being infected or infect others during their duty. They will be provided with instructions on safe disposal mechanisms of used PPE, where they will work under UHWC medical supervision.

Note that UHWC, in coordination with the Ministry of Health, nominated a group of medical teams to receive training at the MoH on mechanisms for dealing with quarantined and isolated families and methods of preventing the spread of infection in addition to the method of using PPE and its safe disposal after use.

In order to raise awareness of the community of COVID-19 prevention measures, so that stop transmission of the infection amp to counteract stigma against infected people, health awareness campaign will be launched including 1 radio spots, 6 sponsored Facebook advertisements consistent with COVID-19 Risk Communication amp Community Engagement Plan.


To speed up the procurement process amp the readiness for the start of implementation once the project is approved, the UHWC&apos;s administration has formed an emergency committee to prepare the project requirements, including identifying specifications amp lists, amp preparing tenders amp offers (the tenders uploaded in the doc. tab). Moreover, the procurement process will start immediately after signing the agreement, based on the procurement emergency plan. In the same context, the project&#x2019;s staff will be hired once the project starts from the available human resources amp HR pool 2020 at UHWC.

It is worth mentioning that the design of the project&apos;s interventions was carried out in coordination with MOH amp the Health Cluster Coordinator. In addition, a letter of support was officially given by MOH to UHWC to implement the services included in the project. (the letter uploaded in docs. tab)

To enable community participation in the project, needs assessment has been done over phone with 50 quarantined amp isolated families in all governorates of the Gaza Strip, they have explained their needs that the project responds to (report uploaded in the docs. tab). At the middle of the project, sample of beneficiaries&#x2019; will be contacted to participate in the monitoring of the project and others will participate in the evaluation questionnaire at the middle amp end of the project.
