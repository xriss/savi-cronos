  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to improve the income, livelihoods and living conditions of the most disadvantaged and marginalised people, including women, indigenous people and people living with disabilities. This project will work with 125 people, of which 75 men and 50 women, including people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups, to support them to diversify their income, livelihoods and learn new skills which can help them to earn an income in the future. 

This will be achieved through:
- Improved technical skills for young people, allowing them to develop sustainable livelihoods or long-term future employment. 
- Decreased levels of discrimination towards people living with disability as PWDs are seen as equal members of the family and are able to generate an income.

The proposed working area is 87 villages of four unions (Nilganj, Dalbuganj, Mithaganj, Tiakhali) under Kalapara Upazila of Patuakhali District in Bangladesh. The total population of the proposed working areas are 65,869 (32,445 men and 33,424 women). 

The learning from the first phase of the Vastenactie/CB project will be incorporated into Phase 2, such as the COVID-19 health and safety measures practiced through trainings being split into 10 students per class as well as PPE being obligatory in each lesson. CB will also maintain their relationships with local government throughout the second phase of the project. 

The Proyash project is a 3-year CAFOD funded project with Caritas Bangladesh and ADD Bangladesh, working to support the most marginalised, particularly women and people living with disability, to practice agroecology techniques and develop sustainable livelihoods. Vastenactie&#x2019;s support, helps to complement this project through working in the same geographical location to provide tailored vocational training to these vulnerable groups.</narrative>
