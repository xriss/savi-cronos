   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malawi Q3 2020 Update: Enrollment for the 2020-2021 season is now underway, and initial results have been strong. We are now on track to meet or exceed our revised target of reaching 36,150 total families in Malawi, with approximately a quarter of those coming from Blantyre. We view this as a success, as it represents a strong gain over the prior year&#x2019;s enrollment (approximately 25,300 farmers in Malawi), and especially because we continue to restrict large gatherings and encourage social distancing in light of COVID-19.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">One Acre Fund is now serving 25,300 clients, a strong testament to the service our program is offering to farmers. We believe that our robust enrollment thus far has been the result of two factors: our strong harvest results in the past season (in which One Acre Fund farmers achieved ~50% higher production than their neighbors who did not enroll in our program), as well as digital tools that have enabled our field staff to continue working while social distancing. Our Malawi team has now moved fully away from paper-based enrollment, with our staff using tablets to collect farmer data and sign them up in our program. Digital enrollment has enabled us to increase efficiencies and improve the accuracy of our data, while maintaining continued service in spite of COVID-19 challenges.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">One Acre Fund&#x2019;s systems change work in Malawi is best reflected by our growing agroforestry trials; we are ramping up production and distribution of seedlings, both to client families through our core program and to non-client families through our decentralized nursery model. Please note that the systems-change scale figure indicated in this report is for our agroforestry work within both the core program and decentralized nursery model). (i) In our core program model, we distributed 24,570 seedlings of three different tree species (Albezia labeck, Gliricidia sepium and Melia azederachwere) to 2,730 farmers in 2019, a meaningful proportion of One Acre Fund&apos;s total core clients in Malawi. (ii) In the decentralized nursery tree-planting model, we partnered with site-level outgrower nurseries to produce and distribute trees. Local entrepreneurs receive nursery &#x2018;starter kits&#x2019; (sockets, seeds and tools) to produce seedlings, then One Acre Fund buys back the seedlings (less the cost of kits) and distributes them to nearby farmers. In the 2019 season, a total of 145,500 Albizia lebbeck seedlings were distributed to 7,540 participating non-client farmers. We are optimistic that our decentralized nursery trial is an exciting innovation with the potential to extend the reach of our agroforestry work beyond our core program.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through our agroforestry platform in Malawi, we are ramping up the production and distribution of seedlings, both to client families through our core program and to non-client families through our decentralized nursery model. In 2020, we reached 60,000 families through this program. Key to our scale growth were the following program improvements:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1)  Widening our tree species offering to now include the mtangatanga tree species. We are pleased to report that so far we have distributed ~800,000 mtangatanga tree seedlings this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                  2) Reducing the cost of the tree package to One Acre Fund by using a site nursery model - every site will have its own nursery, managed by a Group Leader who One Acre Fund will pay per seedling grown. This will be at least 50% cheaper than the current model.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Following these changes, our agroforestry program is on track to reach at least 60,000 farm families.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malawi finished the most recent 2019-2020 season with a 97% loan repayment rate. This represents a strong improvement compared to the previous year, which we attribute in part to the convenience and security of our digital systems. Mobile repayment will continue to be an asset this season, as it will enable us to continue collecting loan repayments while social distancing. However, we expect SROI to fall below target with the main factors driving the year-over-year decrease including lower revenues due to narrow margins, higher costs due to unbudgeted COVID-19 spending (including health trainings to clients and soap distribution to clients and their neighbors), and higher transport costs related to fertilizer supply chain challenges.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Malawi program missed our impact per farmer target on an absolute basis to achieve $14. In 2019, impact suffered from some flooding due to Cyclone Idai at the end of the season, and overall yields were suppressed by too much rain throughout the season. Protecting current impact and increasing impact even further will be a challenge for the next few seasons. We need to ensure food security, but simultaneously need to support farmers with building resilience to various shocks and slightly improve farm incomes through diversified crops. However, in spite of low impact, we recorded a ~80% yield gain which represents the value that our program can continue to generate for farmers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We are still collecting data from the 2020 harvest, so our impact estimates remain very preliminary. However, early results suggest that clients saw strong harvests this year, a powerful impact for food security in a very challenging year. However, external obstacles such as low maize prices appear to have reduced farmers&#x2019; ability to convert bigger harvests into significant new income. Consequently, we are currently projecting average client profit gains of $19. Stepping back, several years of extreme weather and other external shocks have placed increasing strains on Malawian smallholder livelihoods; in response, we implemented a range of measures in 2020 to boost farmer resilience, including promoting crop diversity, increasing maize impact, and optimizing the crop insurance we provide.</narrative>
