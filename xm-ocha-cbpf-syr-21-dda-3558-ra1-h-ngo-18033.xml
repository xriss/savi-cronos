  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will include equipping and operating three geographically distributed medical centers in Deir Ezzor Governorate
Three areas were carefully selected in Deir Ezzor Governorate in coordination with the Health Directorate in Deir Ezzor Governorate and Dr. Haitham Al-Shaher, the health sector official in Deir Al-Zour.
These areas are: (Harabash, Al-Shamtiya, and Al-Sabkhan) located in the south, east and west of Deir Ezzor, and it is one of the most densely populated areas and the most in need, according to the association&apos;s management evaluation team report.
Each medical center will be provided with the following services:
1. Primary health services through three clinics. Internal medicine, gynecology and children.
2. Childcare clinic, which provides health services, including follow-up of child malnutrition cases. It will also provide preventive and curative nutritional supplements for children, with a referral service for acute malnutrition cases to hospitals.
3. Free medicines by referrals from the doctors of the same medical centers.
4- Referrals for surgical procedures (general, neurological, urinary, orthopedic, cardiac, normal deliveries, caesarean section, incubators, and severe malnutrition in children)
5. Provide audio, visual and kinetic secondary medical aids with a referral system.
6. Provide individual mental health care sessions with measures to prevent COVID-19, and will be made available specifically for individuals in post-war trauma.
Each medical center will provide primary and secondary health care services free of charge to the residents of those areas as most of the residents of these areas are internally displaced persons, hosts or returnees.
The headquarters of the centers are the private property of individuals from the local community who provided them free of charge to the association to provide these medical services free of charge in cooperation with a large number of notables in the regions.
Since the association has a branch in Deir Ezzor and has an agreement with the Ministry of Health in the Syrian government to provide care services for cancer patients, the association has the capabilities to implement the project according to the specified date and to obtain administrative approvals very quickly (the association is one of the associations specialized in providing medical services and has full management facilities To obtain the necessary approvals.</narrative>
