Help millions of destitute Yemenis overcome hunger by providing food  assistance (P1/P2).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Proposed target governorates have been identified to have populations in need of humanitarian assistance with Hajjah, Amran, Al Hudaydah in IPC Phase 4 and Aden in IPC Phase 3 with some populations in IPC Phase 4 as reported by the YEMEN: IPC report. Overall, there are more than 4 million IDPs in Yemen uprooted by conflict, facing comparatively high levels of acute food insecurity . Rapid Needs Assessment conducted by NRC also confirms needs in food assistance as the some IDP households are not receiving any support and are highly food insecure. 

The project will improve the food security situation of IDP households and prevent excess negative coping and potential loss of life. Specifically , the action will increase access to diversified and nutritious food for food insecure Internally Displaced Populations (IDPs). The project targets the most food insecure households (HHs) residing in Collective Centres and their related Host Community in five districts of Al Hudaydah, Amran, Hajjah and Aden governorates. To enable the targeted households to meet their immediate basic food needs, NRC will provide Unconditional Cash Grants (UCG)/Value Vouchers/Combination for the Minimum Food Basket (MFB) equivalent to USD80/HH/month for six (6) months. UCGs will be paid in Yemeni Rails at YER45,000/HH/month for Northern governorates and YER53, 000/HH/month for Southern governorates. The proposed action is line with FSAC SO: Increase access to food for highly vulnerable families across the country the intervention is inline with YHF SA1 objective: Help millions of destitute Yemenis overcome hunger by providing food and nutrition assistance, increasing household incomes and advocating for measures that bring economic stability.


The project will benefit 6,643 households Amran (1,114 HH), Hajjah (1,994HH), Al Hudaydah (3,035 HH) and Aden (500HH) governorates.  NRC will use cash/value vouchers/combination to deliver assistance through contracted (FSPs) whom NRC has an active agreement with. Market assessments will be conducted in all six (6) target districts to determine the most suitable modality to be adapted. NRC has extensive experience in using Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) through FSPs and the Red Rose platform. NRC acknowledges risks which may hinder or delay implementation. Key risks include security threats which will be mitigated through securing de-confliction in conflict-active areas and conducting Security Risks Assessments (SRAs) to ensure safety during implementation. Another risk is delayed sub-agreement signing and issuance of field travels permits and this will be mitigated through timely and continuous coordination engagement with respective local authorities. Action can also cause inflation risk and/or market disruptions and NRC will conduct market assessments in all target locations and adopt an appropriate modality of assistance delivery as well as conducting monthly price monitoring of key food commodities. In light of COVID-19, NRC will adopt precautionary measures which included provision of handwashing facilities at payment centres, reduce number of beneficiaries served per day, ensure social distancing and also messaging about the COVID-19 pandemic to raise awarenessAnother key risk is interference on beneficiary selection by Local Authorities (LAs) and/or Community Committees (CCs) this will be mitigated through sensitisation and agreeing on the selection criteria and NRC will conduct 100% verification of the draft lists provided by LAs and CCs. 

During the course of implementation, NRC will ensure that COVID-19 measures are taken into consideration.

- limiting the number of beneficiaries during distribution
- an exemption in the physical signing of distribution registers as proof of receipt
- sensitisation and messaging about the disease at payment centres
- handwashing facilities at all payment centres.</narrative>
