   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the Provision of Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Healthcare Services for the Conflict Affected Population in Need Within Harim District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the SCHF 2020 SA1 allocation- health cluster objectives, and in response to the demonstrated needs and gaps in health service provision for the conflict- affected population within Harim district, Human Appeal (HA) proposes to support the functionality of three healthcare facilities in the district for a duration of 9 months, namely:
	&#x201C;Iman&#x201D; maternity hospital in Sarmada/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: G0703086): Supported from HA direct fund since November 2019.

	Human Appeal Mobile Clinic in Sarmada IDPs camps/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: B0200196): Operated by HA since November 2019 through funding provided by a partner external to OCHA. However, the fund will end by the 31st of May 2020.
	&#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D; IDP camp primary healthcare PHC center in Little Hir Jamus/ Salqin sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: G0703016): Lacking support since the 10th of January 2020 and has since been operated on voluntarily basis by its staff in coordination with IHD.


The above facilities will be providing primary and secondary healthcare services for people in need within their individual catchment areas as follows:
	RH outpatient consultations (All three facilities).
	Pediatric outpatient consultations (All three facilities).
	General medicine outpatient consultations (HA MC and &#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D;).
	Community health awareness services (All three facilities).
	Provision of essential medicines (All three facilities).
	Referral capacity (&#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital and HA MC only).
	CEmONC services, laboratory services, inpatient healthcare for the women of reproductive age and newborns (&#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital only).
	MHPSS and basic trauma care services (&#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D; PHC center).

Besides referring to the health cluster/ Turkey hub dashboard health facilities map, and for the purpose of ensuring coordinated and non-duplicating intervention, HA, during the design phase, was very keen to coordinate and communicate with the partners and coordination bodies relevant to project including Idleb health directorate, SRH TWG, and Sham foundation as being operating a pediatric specialized hospital in Sarmada, the same community where &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital is based (Communication are attached). 

In addition to the above service package, and to ensure integration of COVID-19 related preparedness and response measure, HA proposes to establish and operate COVID-19 triage stations at the entry of both &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital and &#x201C;Samidoon&#x201D; PHC center for a duration of 3 months during the overall project implementation period depending on the situation on the ground, particularly confirming any case of COVID-19 in NW- Syria (However, this component is subject to modification if needed as per the feedback by the relevant reviewing individuals/ committees from the health cluster and OCHA ends in case this application qualifies for further reviews). 

In order to support directing the use of the allocation- matched funds for the purpose of directly serving the targeted population, It&#x2019;s imperative to mention that HA will provide co-funding of around 175,000 USD planned to support the provision of all medicines, medical and lab supplies required at all three facilities, rehabilitation costs of &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital, and provision of the majority of project support staff remuneration costs needed for ensuring the smooth implementation of the proposed activities and provision of the planned healthcare services.

With the above details alongside the planned indicator targets, beneficiaries to be reached and the consideration of the total costs proposed to be matched to this allocation, the cost per medical procedure matched to this application will be less than 7 USD and considering HA co-fund, it will be around 8.5 USD, where both values are considered to be highly efficient against the average cost of around 10-12 USD across NW- Syria.</narrative>
