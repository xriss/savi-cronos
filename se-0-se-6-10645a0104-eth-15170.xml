Together with the Network of Ethiopian Women&#x2019;s Association (NEWA), Ethiopian Women Lawyer&#x2019;s Association (EWLA) and Women Can Do It (WCDI), an assessment of awareness, domestication and implementation of the SDGs with particular focus on SDG 5 has been conducted in 2019. The draft assessment has been used to inform future intervention by CSOs on the popularization the SDGs. Ending Violence Against Women and Girls (EVAWG) &#x2022; During 2019, UN Women worked towards building the capacity of capacity of service providers to provide standardized essential services to survivors of VAWG. In this context, for the first time a national workshop was organized to bring all frontline service providers from health, justice, police, social service and coordination on global essential services package. The workshop was the first of its kind to bring the justice, health, shelters and coordination body in one place to discuss VAWG and the existing response mechanisms. The office also supported the Ethiopian Network of Women Shelters ENWS, an umbrella network for eight shelters, developing national Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to be used across the country by all actors providing shelter services for survivors. UN Women supported three shelters (2 in Oromia and 1 in Amhara) and one new shelter was opened in Hawassa, SNNPR. Through this, a total of 299 survivors and 62 children have benefited from the comprehensive services of legal, psychosocial, medical, skills trainings and reintegration services.&#x2022; UN Women conducted a National Comprehensive Mapping and Analysis of National Laws in Ethiopia as a step towards the elimination of discriminatory laws. The assessment is a comprehensive legislative analysis from a gender perspective to provide an in-depth understanding of the current legal framework and the existence of gaps and discriminatory provisions, with the long-term vision of advocating for law reform to enact new laws or repeal or revise discriminatory legislation. The first draft of the assessment was submitted for review. The validation workshop and launch of the report are planned to be held in March 2020. &#x2022; Another initiative led by UN Women is comprises of advocacy sessions for the adoption of the family law in Somali and Afar regions. An assessment on the general socioeconomic status of women and girls in Somali and Afar regions and barriers hindering the adoption of the family law was conducted. The findings, in addition to the different level dialogues, are believed to be instrumental in repealing of the existing regional laws.&#x2022; UN Women continued its engagement with communities through diverse structured community dialogues conducted in the framework of SASA!, a community-level strategy to address social norms. Two partners, AWSAD and EOC, are undertaking SASA! to create a critical mass and reach other community members with resonance effects. &#x2022; As part of the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) network, co-chair by UN Women and WFP, during July and August over 1,000 IDPs were reached during community consultations activities on existing complaint and feedback mechanism on SEA, referral pathways for GBV survivors, and preferred ways of communicating with communities among affected communities/IDPS, host and returnees community in Somali Region, Gedeo (SNNPR), and West Guji (Oromia) region as well as recommend on suitable ways of reporting sexual exploitation and abuse. Women Economic Empowerment (WEE)&#x2022; During 2019, good progress was made towards contributing to income security, decent work and economic autonomy of rural women in Ethiopia. Through the Joint Programme on Rural Women Economic Empowerment (JP RWEE), implemented in partnership with FAO, IFAD and WFP, targeting a total 3500 rural women in 2019 (existing 2500 and additional 800 women from internally displaced people in Oromia region and 200 from Afar regional state), 2,958 rural women diversified and developed a sustainable source of income (2,730 in Oromia and 228 in Afar). &#x2022; With the aim of improving knowledge and skills of rural women, a total of 603 rural women were trained in diverse areas, namely Business Development Services (BDS), fish production, cattle fattening, milk collection, processing and marketing among others. &#x2022; A total of 340 women accessed land through two cooperatives: Abdi Boru Cooperative in Yaya Gulale district, and Badhatu cooperative in Dodola. In the case of Abdi Boru Cooperative in Yaya Gulale district, 75 women organized into a subgroup to carry out fattening business received land from the government. In the case of Badhatu cooperative in Dodola, the cooperative was provided with 1.5 hectares of land from the government for joint farming activities which benefited 265 members. A rapid assessment and policy brief on Gender and Agricultural Mechanization was drafted to contribute to mainstream gender in the Agricultural Mechanization policy. Additionally, CCAFS and UN Women jointly conducted a draft study to provide qualitative and quantitative information on gender inequalities, social factors and the impact on women&#x2019;s, vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities about agricultural value chains in the context of climate change. The study was conducted in Doyogana District of SNNPR. A study in pastoralist areas, which it is still a draft, was carried out to assess the socio -economic situation of women, identify possible WEE interventions and policy issues in collaboration with UNECA and the Women&#x2019;s Strategic Development Centre. National Planning &#x2022; Significant progress was made with Ministry of Finance and Sectoral Ministries to respond to the gap identified in the Public Finance Management system to include Gender Perspective. UN Women contributed to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Finances and its directorates by the provision of trainings for 45 officials and experts on the developed Gender and Aid effectiveness manual and on the toolkit to support Ethiopian parliament to better implement Gender Responsive Budgeting in response to the key recommendations of the gender gap analysis of the Public Finance Management system. In addition to this, a policy brief on Gender Gap Analysis of the public Finance Management system in Ethiopia was developed. &#x2022; Moreover, 280 high-level officials and experts from 44 sectors were trained on Gender Responsive Budgeting and the concept of Gender Budget Statement in SNNPR. After the training, it was reported that trained officials started working closely with the gender and planning directorate to mainstream gender into the sectors plan.
