   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving reproductive health services through task shifting in conflict-affected Area (Rann-Kala balge)</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project perpetuates the current humanitarian intervention funded by the NHF ending on August 31st in close collaboration with the State Ministry of Health. Tdh has supported the reproductive health services in Rann for over a year, through a community-based approach involving Traditional birth attendants together with community health extension workers, to ensure clean and safe home-based delivery, therefore contributing to the reduction of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. This proposed project seeks to sustain the reproductive health services provided to these vulnerable groups, with the inclusion of promoting Clinic-based deliveries, as well as the clinical management of gender-based violence cases. 
The need for reproductive health and maternal and neonatal health intervention in Rann remain paramount with about 47% of the HH currently host 1 pregnant woman (among which 13% are girls below 18years ) while 58%  of the pregnant women deliver at home , this is based on a need assessment done by TDH hence creating a need to incorporate both community and PHC level services in the intervention.

The logic of intervention is built on 2 components:
1. Support the community with the provision of reproductive health services and maternal and neonatal health at the community and the health facility, to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In Rann due to the limited access to health care services, the CHEWs and the TBAs play a significant role in supporting Maternal and neonatal healthcare services by providing home delivery services in cases of emergency and referring pregnant mothers to the health facility for ANC ,delivery by skilled health workers and PNC. 

Through the intervention, TDH will train the CHEWs and TBAs on safe identification and referral of PLW the health facility , clean delivery and Basic Obstetric and new born care. TBAs will be provided with clean delivery kits to conduct safe and clean home deliveries. 
Tdh engaged medical doctor will visit the Rann weekly to provide attentive supervision and treatment for complicated cases, if appropriate medications are available or certify medical referrals, depending on the security situation to the secondary healthcare. In addition, Tdh will focus on the capacity building of the CHEW on gender-based violence (GBV) and scale up the primary support for clinical management of sexual violence, including the provision of post-rape care, counseling, and referral.

2. Support and engage targeted communities through community-based mechanisms, contributing to creating behavioral change and positive attitude regarding reproductive health, family planning as well as prevention of GBV. Indeed, this will contribute to addressing what has been identified during the needs assessments where 70% of women in Rann  don&#x2019;t have access to family planning services on how to prevent or delay pregnancy. Although the primary target of the project is women and girls, Tdh will ensure awareness-raising among the entire community, involving community leaders, key agents of change in the community and households including Men to create more awareness and acceptance to family planning 
Tdh will also ensure the prevention of major communicable diseases, including Cholera and COVID-19, two critical transmittable dangerous diseases that aggravate population health, threatening and further destabilizing the situation and healthcare situation in Rann.</narrative>
