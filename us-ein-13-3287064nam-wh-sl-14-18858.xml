  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According the Centers for Disease Control, the 2014 Ebola epidemic was the largest in history. Since the first reported case in March 2014, the outbreak claimed thousands of victims. While it affected multiple countries in West Africa, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone experienced the greatest number of infected cases and casualties. World Hope International has been operating in Sierra Leone since 1996, fostering an expansive network of rural communities, which helped to tackle the outbreak at a local level. 



As one of the largest US-based NGOs working in Sierra Leone during the outbreak, WHI partnered with the Ministry of Health, CDC, UNICEF and UKAID and others to fight the disease on many fronts &#x2013; from turning trucks into ambulances, to setting up isolation units, to flying a Registered Nurse from the US to Freetown to train health workers, to helping with burials and delivering food, to providing care for shunned survivors, to creating and maintaining Community Care Centers, the team on the ground worked tirelessly to fight the disease. One example of an ongoing program that directly benefitted the Ebola-stricken area is the Affordable Greenhouses program, a partnership with Penn State&#x2019;s Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship Program (PSU-HESE), which targets the growing food insecurity problem in Sierra Leone. Introduced prior to the Ebola outbreak, the program utilizes WHI&#x2019;s existing network of Village Cooperatives organized through their Outgrowers Project and provides women smallholder farmers an opportunity to learn how to build Affordable Greenhouses, use them to grow vegetables year-round and capitalize on employment and income generation opportunities. This was particularly important during the outbreak as food scarcity became an issue.</narrative>
