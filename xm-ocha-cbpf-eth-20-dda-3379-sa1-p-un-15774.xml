  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is aimed at identifying protection and human right concerns, documenting violations, referring cases to respective service providers and makes an advocacy and capacity building support to right holders and duty bearers. The project will employ seven monitors in seven zones (East, West Wollega, East Guji, Fafan, Sitti, Kamashi, Central Gondar, Dire Dawa/Hararge) of four regional states (Oromia, Benishangul, Amhara, Somali, Harari/Dire Dawa). The project will be implemented in cooperation with the protection cluster in areas of joint presence but also independently by OHCHR-EARO otherwise. IDPs, returnees and host communities will be targeted by the project to understand and address their multi-faceted protection concerns. The office will work with the protection cluster, government partners, and other humanitarian partners on various protection and human right issues. The project cycle for OHCHR ended in July 2020. As the protection gaps and human rights concerns continue to persist OHCHR-EARO&apos;s intervention is crucial to realize right-based protection monitoring and intervention. OHCHR-EARO has been part of various assessments conducted in East Guji, Central Gondar and other project areas that have shown the existence of various protection and human right concerns and necessitated the commencement of its interventions. OHCHR-EARO has been and will be flexible in its intervention approach to cover issues arising in project and surrounding areas as needed using its already established network and work experience. OHCHR believes its continued presence in the field and interventions will contribute to the identification of protection and human right gaps and the delivery of effective response by the concerned authorities and stakeholders. Specifically, the work of the office in referral of cases, advocacy with government and humanitarian partners to address protection gaps and human rights violations and the capacity building activities it planned to deliver to the local level authorities, affected population and other stakeholders will help the protection cluster to achieve its objectives. In addition, OHCHR will continue to provide technical assistance to the protection cluster, government authorities and other humanitarian partners on various protection and human rights issues using different methodologies including radio talk shows, distribution of reading materials, digital platforms etc. to conduct the deliverable of the project in a way that meets the context on the ground/reality. The overall project will significantly contribute in its employment of right-based approach where the affected population as right holders will be enabled to understand. Exercise and claim their basic rights. OHCHR will build on the progress made in ongoing project cycles. In light of the COVID19 pandemic, the project will ensure the affected population (IDPs, returnees and host communities) is included in the response plan of the government in the prevention and response plans by the government and other actors. The project will also ensure measures taken such as the states of emergency with various implications on the enjoyment of human rights will provide enough safeguard and access to basic services and assistance for the most vulnerable sections of the society which includes IDPs, returnees, women, children, people with disabilities and chronic sickness. In that regard, until the pandemic is over, OHCHR&#x2019;s intervention in the coming project cycle in project areas will include COVID-19 monitoring with a specific focus on the affected population and vulnerable groups. Similarly, in light of the upcoming national election, EARO will make effort to provide technical assistance to both right holders and duty bearers to ensure the inclusion and participation of IDPs.</narrative>
