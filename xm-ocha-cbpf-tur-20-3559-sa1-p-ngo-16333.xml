  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WSA runs three WGSSs in Bennish, KafrTakarim, and Kaferlucin in Idleb, NW Syria, and plans to continue implementing activities through providing protection services for women and girls affected by the crisis, including GBV survivors and persons affected by war injuries and mild physical disabilities. These are backed by Casualty Data Collection that is going to be shared with IMSMA and to help in identifying cases and needs for planning. Besides the three mentioned locations, our partner NAS will conduct RE and VDC services in Idlib sub-district. COVID-19 awareness messages -and prevention procedures- will be put into consideration in all activities.
The WGSS in Bennish, provides protection services for WampG, in line with the UNFPA Guidelines, including WampG with a mild physical disability. The center contributes to the promotion of services and measures of MA and quality GBV services providing appropriate services to prevent and reduce the risks of GBV, ERW, and COVID-19 in the mentioned location. The center offers child care to improve access for women with little children, besides an outreach service through trained mobile teams that can reach beneficiaries who cannot come, or have no access, to the center. According to the latest developments regarding the global pandemic of Coronavirus, the WHO guidelines, and following the guidance note on the provision of GBV and MA services during the COVID-19  Pandemic, developed by the GBV and MA SCs WSA has begun to provide the services by reducing the number of beneficiaries inside the centers and increase the outreach activities, taking into account the recommended prevention measures.

In terms of the other two locations (in KafrTakarim and Kaferlucin), MA service will be provided, including RE and VDC, plus referring cases in need of individual assistance. These services are going to be provided through fixed and outreach activities.
Indoor activities:

Train teams on how to prevent COVID-19 and RE communicating messages to beneficiaries (IDPs, host community, and humanitarian actors), casualty surveys, GBV, and RE.
Provide specialized GBV services and CM, in addition to group and specialized individual PSS. 2 CM workers will follow up with the WampG-GBV survivors- including survivors of ERW accidents and affected by war injuries and mild physical disabilities. In addition to providing direct support service and referrals to other services according to the referral paths that are shared by the sub-clusters, and service mapping through coordination with actors in the area, continuously updated.
Provide vocational training (sewing) for the most vulnerable WampG.
Case management principles to be followed, privacy, informed, a survivor code. All case-related files are kept confidentially in a locked cabinet and are periodically destroyed after e-copies are held secured, where only the CW and the T-supervisor can reach them.
