   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall medium-term objective of the project is to reduce the incidence of community transmission of COVID-19 (and by extension waterborne diseases) in poor urban settings, while increasing community resilience to disease outbreak and encouraging better health and hygiene seeking behaviour among vulnerable populations. Over the 12-month period of implementation, the project will deliver better WASH infrastructure and improved access to water, sanitation and hygiene in communities, including through health facilities and schools, to help address the preventive and curative needs of 6-8 low-income urban communities and benefitting approximately 50-80,000 people. The project will also promote hygiene and health seeking behaviour and increased access to welfare/ protection systems by women, adolescent girls and children, including in respect to SGBV. The project will also improve information systems for service delivery planning, and preparedness and response in urban settings.</narrative>
