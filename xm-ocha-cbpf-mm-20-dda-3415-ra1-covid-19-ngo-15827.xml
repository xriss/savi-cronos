   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COVID-19 Humanitarian Response Program for IDPs in Paletwa Township in Chin State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fighting between(AA and the Myanmar Military intensified in Rakhine and Chin States and the total estimated displacement in Paletwa now stands at 6498.  This caused many villagers had to abandoned their home and properties and fled to Paletwa and Samee towns. These IDPs are taking a refuge in churches, monasteries, schools, and government buildings. The main road routes (car road and water way) between Kyauktaw and Paletwa are blocked as well as internet is banned since first week of February. Approximately 3,922 (858 HH) are in Paletwa town, 2,576 (573 HH) are in Samee town The current conditions of camps (temporary refuge) are congested and lack of clean water, not enough latrine for many people, most of them are doing open defecation. 


The project aims to improved access to water supply, improved personal hygiene knowledge and practices,  improved shelter conditions of IDPs to prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus through mindful of social distancing orders from Government and following further guidance from MoHS. Therefore, KMSS is planning to help protect those IDPs and host communities from COVID-19 by doing hygiene promotion awareness sessions, distribution of IEC materials, providing hygiene kits, installation of hand washing station, renovation and improvement of water sources and supplies, improvement of water supply system, construction of temporary water storage and distribution of household water container as well as improvement of shelter conditions through providing the shelter extension supports.


The activities will be implemented by KMSS for WASH and Global Family (GF) for shelter and NFI supports such as blanket, mat, mosquito nets, mattress, and solar lamp. The  beneficiaries are displaced to 12 locations, where integrated multi- sector emergency mechanism for WASH, Shelter and NFI distribution will be implemented.

The WASH component will support the construction of WASH infrastructure and hygiene kits to meet 100% of minimum standards for water and sanitation in 12 locations. KMSS will also support regular hygiene promotion awareness session including Covid-19 Risk Communication and Community Engagement through recruitment of local volunteers and training of them and delivery of hygiene promotion messages. Solid waste management and disposal is one of the key components of our hygiene promotion. 

KMSS will also focus on building capacity of the community to self-manage the water, sanitation and hygiene in their location through training to the community leaders/ committees on operation and maintenance of facilities, water testing and water safety.

The shelter activities will be implemented by GF in 12 locations to improve shelter conditions of IDP in the said locations. The diversity of shelter situation would require different type of shelter support in this planned of GF operations. Shelter support will be provided for extension of the existing shelters to ensure safety of their life (physical distancing), their dignity of life under displacement and COVID-19 pandemic crisis. In addition,  NFI distribution will be conducted by GF in 12 locations.

KMSS and GF plans to reach total of 1,431 HH with 6,498 persons (female-3,391, male-2,982 which include 125 disable people from both towns. KMSS and GF will  ensure to inclusion of women, girls and disable persons, the most vulnerable persons.

KMSS is making sure that, hygiene promotion session will be conducted for different age, and gender groups and also make sure of physical distancing during the session. Especially for children, KMSS will disseminate through mother to child, and child to child approaches, and using IEC materials which can easily understand by children. The project will make sure the location of latrines will be separate for women, men and children to minimizing the risk of Gender-based violence. For easy and safe access for children and disable persons will include in the design of the latrine</narrative>
