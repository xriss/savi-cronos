Reve Group is a leading Latin American retail and consumer foodservice company operating in Colombia, Panama and Chile. Proceeds will be used to fund working capital requirements of Reves operations and its continued expansion during 2020 and part of 2021</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC&apos;s Real Sector COVID-19 Facility is intended to promote the resilience of real sector markets, by ensuring continued supply of goods and services at affordable prices and limiting disruptions along supply chains thereby mitigating the effects of the economic downturn. All IFC projects under the COVID-19 Facility share the same development thesis: By supporting its clients&apos; capacity to sustain operations during this acute shock, IFC best positions the private sector to support the economic recovery process, shortening the time it will take for the most vulnerable to return to their traditional income-earning opportunities. The Project will strengthen the Reve Group ability to meet surging demand of low-priced essential goods, to ensure continued access to supply, and to resume expansion when the situation improves.</narrative>
