   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH Response in Aleppo, Hama and Deir-ez-Zor</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This 12- month project has two parts: the first is in As-Safira and Banan sub-districts of Aleppo, and Suran district in Hama to meet life-saving WASH needs of 172,824 persons. The second is to restore WASH facilities in 4 schools in Ashara, Deir-ez-Zor. The project has 3 outcomes:
1) Vulnerable communities have access to sustainably managed and improved water and sanitation services.

2) Mothers and carers are able to practice and influence hygiene behaviour change through hygiene awareness and access to hygiene items, and adolescent girls are better informed and able to manage menstruation. 
3) Meet the WASH facility needs of children in schools. Besides SHF, complementary / supportive activities under this outcome will also be co-funded by FCDO ($390k for hygiene promotion in schools and communities) and ECHO ($400k for rehabilitation of water and sanitation infrastructure). 

All the outcomes contribute to addressing humanitarian needs in underserved areas as outlined in the allocation paper, and also preventive measures required for COVID-19 as per Response Plan.
Outcome 1 will reach 20,743 people with improved access to water as a result of repair and rehabilitation of 2 water systems. Frontline technical staff from the local water establishment and sewerage and sanitation department will also be assessed and trained to meet gaps in their capacity to operate and maintain the water and sanitation system. This will benefit a population of 70,050 people with a sustainably managed water supply.
Outcome 2 will reach 17,500 people by hygiene promotion activities and campaigns employing Mum&#x2019;s Magic Hands (MMH), a versatile evidenced-based behaviour change approach that employs using emotional motivators through storytelling, positively reinforcing good behaviours and activities. MMH is based on formative research conducted by Oxfam amp Unilever to better understand motivators and barriers among mothers affected by emergency and has been used in several countries. 
In As-Safira Aleppo, we will use MMH approach to improve the identified priority risky hygiene behaviours related to poor personal and environmental hygiene conditions, including menstrual hygiene, handwashing and adapting COVID-19 safe measures. This will involve mobilising 25 MMH Community-based volunteers, who will be trained to facilitate basic hygiene awareness and water related disease prevention to 2,500 mothers and carers of 1,250 children including those with disabilities. They will also track and report on the communities&#x2019; perceptions about C19 to bring in evidence of more effective measures. 1,750 men, women and disabled persons will be selected according to a community criterion and receive essential family hygiene kits in the community and 1,150 girls will receive female hygiene kits appropriate to their age. 
Outcome 3: To support this project, a separately funded outcome will ensure within the locations, 10 Schools are assessed in consultation with the Directorate of Education, whereby an output will include 4 schools and their catchments population more focused to school children will gain access to gender and disability friendly WASH facilities and services. All children will attend conservation awareness that is attributed to water and environmental sanitation, and hygiene awareness related to COVID19 and water related disease prevention measures.

Oxfam is already implementing a multisectoral programme in neighbouring areas in the southern rural Aleppo covering WASH and food security needs and has good access to the targeted locations and communities.
In Deir-ez-Zor, this project will complement existing work funded by ECHO and FCDO in Ashara, providing the final piece of the puzzle for 4 schools and their catchments to have access to appropriate WASH facilities, hygiene materials and hygiene promotion. Restored infrastructure, to which schools will be connected through this project, will also benefit households in surrounding communities.</narrative>
