  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HelpAge will improve the awareness of the needs of older people and other vulnerable groups among the population of Myanmar regarding the COVID-19 virus. Current messaging developed for Myanmar by MoHS and WHO does not include specific mentions of these groups. Through partnerships with the MoHS and the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief, and Resettlement, handouts, posters, and banners will be distributed nationwide &#x2013; this is a replication of the distribution of information of the Package of Essential NCD (PEN) services under HelpAge&apos;s EU funded project (Specific objective 1). Following improved awareness, it is imperative to support the communities to implement preventive measures. Communities will be provided with financial support by HelpAge to procure materials. HelpAge has experience in providing this kind of support, and has provided procurement training to the communities under previous projects. The installation of hand-washing stations and the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) for home care volunteers will help the communities to limit the spread of the virus, and therefore reduce the demand on healthcare services nationwide (Specific objective 2). Global evidences reveal that older people and persons living with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are more susceptible to develop life-threatening complications from a COVID-19 infection; hence there is a need to address their needs at the community level on a priority basis. 


HelpAge&apos;s previous EU-funded project supported the MoHS in strengthening NCD services, through 1,800 NCD clinics which are established in Rural Health Centres (RHCs). HelpAge proposes to provide these clinics with PPE, strengthening their reporting and registration system to improve the quality of their data, and streamline their referral system through a digitalised system (Specific objective 3). Lastly, the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak will have severe effects on the livelihoods of vulnerable people, who often rely on their families and communities to survive. HelpAge has worked with the ISHGs to set up income-generating ventures in communities that support vulnerable groups. The ISHG structure is support by their umbrella organisations, Township Network Committees (TNCs), which consist of representatives of the ISHGs and coordinate and align similar activities between the ISHGs. The TNCs have received procurement training under previous HelpAge projects, and building upon this, HelpAge will provide financial support to TNCs to procure the raw materials for ISHGs produce soap, hand sanitiser, and dispensers in communities, which can generate income during and after the project (Specific objective 4).</narrative>
