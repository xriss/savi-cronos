       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Results of Output targets 1.1.
- Result achieved: Yields vary by crop types and low-water irrigation types. Crops harvested with sprinkler irrigation consumed in average around 35% less water than specified by norms while gave about 32% more yield. Drip irrigation results are even better with nearly 40% less water than specified by norms while around 54% more yield than with traditional furrow irrigation types.
- Result achieved: Application of low-water irrigation systems by 30 percent normalized energy consumption at Geokdepe research site relative to similar sites.
- Result not achieved, but progressing: The project took certain measures to combat salinization at Geokdepe 145 ha plot through improvements in drainage canals in 2016, construction of piped irrigation network in 2017, construction of low-water irrigation systems and planting some crops irrigated with efficient irrigation technologies in 2018. The project experts also provide advisory support and trainings to local farmers working at research site and other neighbouring farms on efficient water use and SLM techniques. All these activities will contribute to remediation of lands from salinization. Land rehabilitation and salinity reduction process normally takes several years, so project will be monitoring salinity level throughout the project lifetime.

Results of Output targets 1.2.
- Result achieved: Project experts conducted audit of efficiency and energy consumption of 121 pumps including 46 diesel pumps in 2017.
- Result not achieved, but progressing: Supplier contracted to replace five physically worn pumps by brand new energy efficient ones in 2019. Based on the average energy specifications of baseline pump-sets (about 100 kW) and new pumps (45 kW), it is expected to achieve approx. 50% energy saving.

Results of Output targets 1.3.
- Result not achieved, but progressing: The tender for installation of renewable-energy applications of water pumping and purification is ready now for announcement. The total number of beneficiaries will exceed 1200 people.

Results of Output targets 2.1.
- Result achieved: 15 km long water supply pipeline for the Kaahkha district successfully launched in 2018 and practically eliminated water loss between withdrawal and water treatment facilities.
- Result achieved: As noted by local authorities recently built Kaahka water pipeline substantially increased reliability of water supply as previously earthen river course was frequently damaged by mudflows which often happen in mountainous regions. Based on the calculations of International Expert on GHG emission reduction, Kaahka water pipeline result in annual energy savings of about 1000 MWh, and reduction of associated GHG emissions by 785 tCO2/year.
- Result not achieved, but progressing: Preliminary estimates display up to 50% of water economy, with lifetime direct GHG emission reductions from operation of the combined water supply system in Kaakhka town are anticipated at 15,694 tCO2. Given its high replication potential in the country, a dialogue with the government is now underway to upscale this water-energy nexus effect.

Results of Output targets 2.2.
- Result not achieved: National and International Experts in Irrigation Canals are on board, so starting from early 2019 they will be actively engaged in activities on testing various canal lining materials and preparation of recommendations on industrial production of at least two types of products.

Results of Output targets 3.1.
- Result not achieved, but progressing: In 2018 the project developed methodology on development of inter-farm water use plans. The project plans to test the methodology on the farms of selected private farmers. The outcome of these activities will be used for further works on development of integrated regional sustainable water management plans with consideration of SLM at the level of etraps (districts). Furthermore, initial results of low-water irrigation demonstrations complemented with land management techniques at Geokdepe green polygon can serve as foundation for development of Water Distribution Plans with proven water and land management practices.

Results of Output targets 3.2.
- Result achieved: Nearly 150 national specialists representing Ministry of Agriculture and Water, Water Design Institute, Ministry of Nature Protection and farmers have been trained locally and abroad since the beginning of the project in various topics related to rational water management, energy efficient irrigation techniques, pump maintenance and SLM. Positive feedback rate from training participants is around 92%. 

Results of Output targets 4.1.
- Result not achieved, but progressing: The project developed four regulatory acts to support Water Code, including (i) operational regulations for pump stations; (ii) regulation for scheduled preventive maintenance and repair of water systems and facilities; (iii) technical regulations of irrigation infrastructure; and (iv) technical regulations of drainage infrastructure. The documents are currently under consideration of Ministry of Agriculture and Water Economy and other relevant state agencies. 

Results of Output targets 4.3.
- Result not achieved, but progressing: Following presidential order on development of the Water Development Program of Turkmenistan for 2018-2030, Ministry of agriculture and water economy and its Water Design Institute started working on the strategic development document from early 2018. Project experts who directly involved in creation of water saving Geokdepe research site provided advisory support with technical and financial justifications to government authorities to promote replication of Geokdepe site activities through inclusion of modern low-water irrigation systems to the Water Program. Currently, the final draft of the Program is under review of the top water sector authorities.

Results of Output targets 4.4.
- Result achieved: Baseline data collection program for the Kaahka pilot project has been prepared and initiated in 2016 through installation of water measuring devices at the source and lower stream of the current open-water channel that supply drinking water to the town of Kaahka. These meters enabled the project to accurately measure and calculate the average monthly water flow. Water metering was further improved with construction of water distribution point as part of the Kaahka water pipeline project completed in April 2018.
Testing of water measurement devices at Geokdepe demonstration site started in 2017 when piped irrigation network was built. Additional water meters were installed along with drip and sprinkler irrigation systems in June 2018 when collection of water consumption figures continued more intensively with planting of various crops.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Result 1.1: As a result of the reporting year activities and previous years reclamation works, ameliorative condition of all arable lands of 145 ha Geokdepe site was improved. In addition, at the whole territory of green polygon the cross sections of open drainage collectors were cleared of weeds. Reconstruction of the collector-drainage canals completed back in 2016 allowed the entire territory to provide the necessary drainage of excess groundwater and lower its level, thereby eliminating the possibility of secondary salinization of soils. It became possible not only to collect collector-drainage water on green polygon, but also to improve the quality of collector-drainage water of neighbouring lands of an area of almost 270 hectares. In addition, operation of collectors 2D-3-6 and GKS-2-1 led to a decrease in the level of groundwater in adjacent neighbouring lands (at 70-80 m distance from the edge of the collectors) with a total area of 18.5 hectares. All these activities allowed to exceed the target.

Result 2.2:  not achieved but it is in progress. Based on the recommendations of the International Consultant in irrigation canals, lining types suitable for climatic and soil conditions of Turkmenistan, and using local materials, were identified (water-proof membrane protected by an intermediate layer of sand and a layer of hexagonal slabs). The EERE project has already purchased 1,000 formworks for precast hexagonal concrete slabs. The procurement of a HDPE (waterproof membrane) extrusion line (to produce membranes with thickness of up to 1 mm) is in progress. Due to Covid-19 related constraints the delivery of equipment is expected in February 2021.

Result 3.1: not achieved but it is in progress. Project prepared 1st edition of a methodology for the development of on-farm and inter-farm water use plans and demonstrated it to national water specialists and received several comments from State Water Committee. Recently, project addressed all comments based on the 2018-2020 research results. 2nd edition of a methodology has passed the initial examination and was re-submitted to the State Water Committee for approval. Approval is expected on March-April 2021. During 2021, project plans to complete the development of the final version of the Water-use Planning Methodology. Therefore, 1 comprehensive plan for water use and water distribution at the velayat level will be developed and submitted for approval, and recommendations for the other 2 velayats will be developed.

Result 3.2 achieved: Over 360 national specialists representing Water Committee, Ministry of Agriculture and Nature Protection, Water Design Institute, students of Agricultural University and farmers have been trained locally and abroad since the beginning of the project in various topics related to rational water management, energy efficient irrigation techniques, pump maintenance, IWRM and SLM. Positive feedback rate from training participants is over 90%.

Result 4.1 achieved: The regulatory documents in the field of integrated management and protection of water resources were developed, agreed with the interested ministries and institutions, and submitted for approval with a total of 9 documents. These documents have been prepared considering the use of modern water and energy saving technologies in the agricultural and water sectors of the country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the national partner was presented with the &#x201C;Regulations on territorial water management organizations, water protection zones and coastal water protection zones of water bodies&#x201D;. The newly developed editions of Construction Norms of Turkmenistan &quot;Amelioration systems and structures&quot; and an updated version of its application &quot;Operation of irrigation and drainage systems&quot;, as well as Construction norms &quot;Instructions for the design and construction of anti-seepage devices made of polyethylene (polymer) film for artificial reservoirs (watercourses)&quot; were submitted to the Ministry of Construction and Architecture.</narrative>
