   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency shelter and life-saving Non Food Items within Covid-19 guidelines to vulnerable flood-affected populations in Duk and Twic East Counties in Jonglei state</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan has been hit by heavy rains since the start of the long rain season in April 2020. This caused increased water levels on the Nile River and was  compounded by more than normal rainfall in part of East Africa (FAO Rainfall Projection 2020). The affected populations have moved to mostly schools found on higher grounds where they are facing additional health  risks due to lack of food, drinking water, Shelter and living in crowded areas which may expose them Covid 19 (Duk and Twice East IRNA reports of July/August 2020) 


The UN Office for  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported on 03 September that flooding in areas along the White Nile has affected 24 counties in 6 states since July this year. According to OCHA, a coordinated humanitarian response scale-up in the most affected states of Jonglei, Lakes, and Unity was initiated to respond to the increased needs of people affected and displaced by the floodwaters. Touch Africa Development Organization (TADO) operating in Jonglei state with support from SFP/NFI cluster and other implementing partners such as CIDO, HDC, ADA amp PA proposes to contribute to this emergency response through a Shelter and No- food items intervention in Duk (26,000 individuals) and Twic East (15,200 individuals) Counties of Jonglei State.


The intervention and severity of needs for these locations are informed by verified information retrieved from various sources including (UNOCHA, I OM-DTM, and WFP reports ) and coordinated assessment by different partners on the ground in order to respond to the alerts. The proposed project will provide access to emergency shelter and lifesaving non-food items to the flood-displaced people in a timely manner through the deployment of TADO rapid response teams in line with humanitarian priorities outlined in the Humanitarian Response plan 2020 (HRP). 

The project has the overall objective to Provide equitable, dignified, and Covid-19 informed access to emergency shelter amp NFIs to 41,200 most vulnerable flood-affected individuals in Duk amp Twic East Counties of Jonglei State over a 6 month period.

In the pursuit of this objective, the project envisions two outcomes: (1).41,200 most vulnerable flood-affected individuals (17,508 Women, 9,505 Men, 8,409 Girls amp 5,778 Boys) in Duk and Twick East Counties have access to life-saving emergency shelter and non-food items., and (2). Increased awareness and response on cross-cutting issues including gender, protection, and the Covid-19 pandemic among the most vulnerable flood-affected populations in Duk and Twic East Counties. End cycle target beneficiaries include 17,508 women, 9,505 men, 8,409 girls amp 5,778 boys being individuals from Host Communities(8,338), IDPs (26,507), and Returnees (6,355). An estimated 1,385 PWDs are targeted.

The planned activities focus on strengthening Accountability to Affected Populations through the negotiated entry into the communities through recognized community gate-keepers including state authorities, religious leaders, youth leaders, women leaders, and other stakeholders who will be identified and trained to form Beneficiary Accountability Committees (BAC). Project conceptualization, planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation including feedback mechanisms will be done in a participatory manner with the participation of the BACs.
Covid-19 awareness and capacity for responding to cross-cutting issues including gender and protection concerns will be mainstreamed and conducted throughout the project implementation period. Needs assessments, Beneficiary registration and verification, and distribution of NFIs and Emergency Shelter kits will be done collaboratively with the BACs.. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning will be a continuous activity. TADO has specialist staff with the technical capacity and experience to undertake this project.</narrative>
