   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the distribution of unconditional cash, this project will empower the community as we will do a survey prior to the cash distribution to assess the power dynamic within HHs and carry out sensitisation around targeting, especially as it will be largely women who will be receiving the cash on behalf of the HHs. Priority will be given to the most vulnerable households  affected by the current attack, including widowed women, children heads of households, elderly people, people with disabilities, chronically ill, and / or other people who are unable to buy  goods of their choice that meet the need of their households. The targeting criteria will be included within the sensitisation to ensure the do no harm principle is adhered to. The targeting criteria will also be informed by a tool developed through a recent Start Fund Learning Grant (see section 2.3 below for more information).
We will organize the mobile banking  through which each household will receive &#xA3;58.14. The head of the household will receive the cash for the HH. This amount has been advised by the NFI cluster group. Throughout the project, we will take into account the COVID-19 prevention measures as stated by the government and include COVID-19 sensitisation activities which will reach 16,200 people. The vulnerabilities of certain groups will be taken into consideration. The cash will be done through mobile banking which means people will not have to wait in long queues to receive their cash. Queues will also be socially distanced.  CAFOD and SOCOAC will target 1250 households (7500 individuals) with unconditional cash, among them:1125 of those affected directly by the attack and125 of the host famillies affected by the current crisis, especially in the city of  Mangina in Mabalako health zone. This represents respectively 75% of1500 direct affected HH and 10,4% of 1200 host families to ensure &quot;Do No Harm&quot; is taken into consideration.</narrative>
