   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project target 7 schools in 7 communities in Idleb (Salqin, Dana, Qourqeena), these schools were supported under SCHF project (12682) in the period between 12-6-2019 to 11-6-2020, and the two proposed phases are:
1-During COVID-19: although there are no confirmed cases in NW Syria, it is expected that this phase will last until September 2020, during this period we propose the provision of remedial classes and as schools are closed it is a better time for conduct some maintenance and rehab:

-Provision of remedial classes to children who couldn&#x2019;t attend and/or finalize the last semester properly because of the last displacement from Dec19 to the end of Feb20, and the closure of schools starting from the mid of March20,  children might be are at risk of dropping out or have poor education score according to their level of education, the proposed targeted children is 4578 (2223 B, 2355 G), GAN will provide PSS and SEL activities to children through online system and communications using WhatsApp groups if the schools still closed or physically if it is opend, and online training about Google services (YouTube, Forms, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Gmail, Drive, Classrooms) will be provided to teachers to help them deal with distance learning modality, as some other required tools for schools like(mics, tripod for mobiles, internet packages..etc), children will be provided with monthly internet packages, the 9th and 12th grade exams will be supported that will take place in July 20 (through provision of needed human resources and running cost for schools).
During the displacement period, 5 out of 7 targeted schools were occupied by IDPs, and this affected the furniture of schools in general, so light maintenance and rehabilitation will be provided, the scope of rehab will include the classrooms (windows and doors) as WASH facilities and ensure that all are adapted to receive children with disabilities, in addition, to repair school furniture like (students&#x2019; desks, Cupboard, teachers&#x2019; tables, and whiteboards), these rehab activities will improve and increase the safe access to schools and ensure children are receiving education in a safe and protected environment, as parents might not send their children to schools due to the inappropriate school condition. Rehabilitating schools will be as preparedness for after COVID-19 phase and make sure that school absorption capacity is increased by activating 6 classrooms in 2 schools also.


2-After COVID-19: provision of formal and education for the 7 schools, the targeted schools are the same target in the summer phase and accommodate about 5400 students including (2580 B, 2820 G), GAN will conduct BTL campaigns in the 7 targeted communities before starting the academic year to raise awareness about the importance of education for both boys, girls and flag the risks of not enrolling children in schools, as send so key messages about hygiene, after that ASER test will be conducted to help us better plan and focus on the needed type of educational activities based on ASER results, also to capture the impact of the intervention, children will be provided with learning materials (bag, stationery, notebooks..etc.) according to the gender and age and children will be trained on the safety and security plans, the PSS activities will be provided for all students, one session a week following the CP-sub cluster guidelines and referral pathways in addition to, the protection staff will be trained on CP minimum standards, teacher and education personnel will be provided with incentives and teaching and learning materials, the curriculum used is SIG and high level of coordination with ED and other working organization will be ensured to avoid duplications, the whole project activities will be implemented following the EiE, INEE guidelines and CHPs</narrative>
