   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing home care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 during home isolation and scale up COVID-19 infection prevention and control.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project overall objective is &#x201C;to follow up with COVID suspected and positive cases at home in order to break the chains of transmission of the virus and to help the fragile health care system to cope with the situation and enable hospitals to provide treatment for moderate and severe cases.&#x201D; 
The project targets 3000 suspected and positive cases with no or mild symptoms and 12000 of their family members during the period of home isolation. The targeted beneficiaries are selected from North and Gaza governorates as 88.5% of detected cases are from those areas. The list of suspected and positive cases will be obtained from MoH where PMRS is already a member of the home care group for isolated and quarantined cases. The project implementation period is 9 months including 8 months for activities and 1 month for closing.

Home-based care will be provided by 4 health workers and 4 mobile health teams consist of one doctor and one nurse in each team. The 4 health workers are responsible for monitoring patients and caregivers in the home by giving telephone calls every day or day after day for the duration of the home-care period, that is, until the patient&#x2019;s symptoms have completely resolved. The health worker will fill checklist including set of questions and some vital signs as temperature, cough difficulty in breathing and other parameters to help them recognizes signs that the COVID-19 patient&#x2019;s condition is worsening or suspected cases developed symptoms of COVID infection. In this case they will report the development in symptoms and signs of the case to the mobile health teams for further follow up.
The mobile health team will visit suspected cases who developed symptoms during home quarantine and confirmed cases when their condition has been deteriorated during the period of home isolation. The team will do medical checkup and decide if treatment can be continued at home or the case need for hospitalization. Mainly suspected cases who developed symptoms will be sent for hospitalization if they have risk factors for severe disease (i.e. age (gt 60 years), smoking, obesity and no communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression and cancer. The mobile teams will be supplied with PPE as they are at risk when dealing with suspected and confirmed cases. The teams will be trained in the use of PPE and will apply IPC during their work. 

The project will support all confirmed cases with mild symptoms with standard home isolation kit already defined by MoH during period of isolation. Also the project supports families for implementing appropriate IPC by providing family with hygiene kits to insure their adherence to the recommendations for home care quarantine.  All kits will be delivered to cases and their families by the social workers immediately when home quarantine is decided. Caregivers and household members should receive guidance booklet on how to adhere to the IPC recommendations, booklets will be printed and distributed with the kits. Also the mobile health team will coordinate with preventive medicine teams about the cases they follow ups and coordinate to bring the teams to take samples for PCR tests, and if required for hospitalization.</narrative>
