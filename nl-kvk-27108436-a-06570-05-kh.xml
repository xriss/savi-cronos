   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Revenue collection is important for national development of Cambodia and sustaining Cambodia&apos;s economic growths. Many reforms in public financial management for past years have yielded significant result. Not until the occurrence of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Royal Government has injected billions of dollars from the national reserves and national budget through the Covid-19 intervention measures. Cambodia&apos;s economy is projected to decrease to around 2 percent of total GDP growth for the year 2020. The Government intervention measure of Covid-19 has greatly touched on the delay of paying taxes and tax declaration for any affected sectors and yield greater losses on government revenue. Such phenomena requires stronger scrutiny from the public and civil society organization over fiscal accountability both revenue and expenditure of national budget.

However, despite the progress in terms of revenue collection and taxation and increases of public expenditures, according to Open Budget Survey in 2019, the role of citizen in the budget process remains limited throughout the whole budget process ranging from budget proposal, implementation of the budget plan, and the evaluation of the budget. Several reasons that can explain this problem is firstly the lack of platform where citizen can participate in the process, especially at a national level. Second, the nature of budget process is highly technical that it requires participants topossess a certain extent of knowledge in order to be able to participate meaningfully.Therefore, TI Cambodia&#x2019;s strategy focuses mainly on the role of youth in participating in budget process at both national and sub-national level. The initiative named &#x201C;Young Budget Trackers&#x201D; is created to bring together young and potential youth  to contribute in policy research and advocacy on open budget, taxation, and pro-poor and FAIR tax and trade policy to the Royal Government of Cambodia to promote fiscal accountability and transparency. Well-equipped and qualified youth will be ableto use evident based research as an advocacy to policy makers and stakeholders involved.More open space for citizen and youth to actively engage in fiscal accountability through evident based advocacy on open budget, taxation, pro-poor and FAIR tax and trade policy at national and sub-national levels.OUTCOME: Broader youth participation in fiscal accountabilityOUTPUT 1: Youth&#x2019; knowledge and capacity on national and sub national budget process, taxation, pro-poor and FAIR tax and trade policy enhancedOUTPUT 2: Youth&#x2019;s participation and advocacy for fiscal accountability through evident basedadvocacy at national and sub-national levels empowered</narrative>
