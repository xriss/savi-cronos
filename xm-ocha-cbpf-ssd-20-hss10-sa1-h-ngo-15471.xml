   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing access and strengthening the provision of emergency lifesaving health care services in Manyo county through the provision of 1 PHCC and 1 mobile clinic response.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite the peace and stability that the country is currently experiencing, the devastation caused by six years conflict in South Sudan and most especially in Manyo county in northern part of Upper Nile state will not get recovered in shortest time as expected in other counties of Upper Nile state. Manyo County is estimated in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), a situation driven by depleted stocks, high food prices, and a reduction in the availability of livestock products as cattle move away from homesteads during the displacement. However, availability of fish will counter some of the resultant food gaps. During the lean season that runs from May to July 2020, Manyo county will be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). During this period, the effects of the lean season will result in an estimated 915,000 people, 67% of the population in Upper state, being in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse acute food insecurity. The high levels of food insecurity are driven by lack of stocks, degradation of road infrastructure that limits market functionality and access, increased incidences of water-borne illnesses. Wild foods and livestock products will however be available during this wet season and their consumption will prevent a further deterioration of the food security situation. According to REACH report of June 2019, a multi-sectoral need health assessment was conducted in Renk county which has similar situation and a neighbor to Manyo county on the Eastern bank of River Nile and the findings shows global acute malnutrition (GAM) for Renk host community was 32.1% (27.4 &#x2013; 37.2 95% CI), and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) of 8.5% (6.0 &#x2013; 11.9 95% CI), a value double the WHO recommended emergency threshold  and the highest GAM in South Sudan as of July for 2019. This project will address the health needs of the people of Manyo county through provision of emergency lifesaving healthcare services by supporting 1PHCC, and 1mobile clinic. This project is a complementary to 12 supported health facilities by Cordaid and CASS under World Bank grant (Lot 1) and two health facilities supported by Medicare under 2020 SSHF SA1. Although some host community have courageously managed to returned back to Manyo county from the refugee settlements in White Nile state and Kordofan region in Sudan, there has not been any humanitarian partner with permanent presence in the county. The host community in Manyo county have been getting humanitarian support through mobile response by the partners residing in Renk county. This project will benefit all gender groups including, 12,289 men, 12,790 women, 3,267 boys and 3,400 girls in Manyo county. In Manyo, UNIDOR will also support the psycho social and basic mental health services through case identification, first aid counseling, treatment and referral of the clients to nearby health county or state hospitals. Lack of women participation due to cultural issues, low education level and discrimination has disadvantaged women against men. UNIDOR will ensure women issues are considered in the project and their involvement and opinion incorporated in decision making and project improvement. The project will also response to COVID-19 pandemic through raising of awareness in the community and health facilities levels on COVID-19 preventive measures, surveillance and risk communication.</narrative>
