   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increased food security and income among vulnerable farmers in Mvolo county, South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support a transition from subsistence farming and aid dependency to sustainable livelihoods and development by building the capacity of 2000 farmers in 66 villages in Mvolo County, South Sudan. The project will promote peaceful coexistence among community stakeholders, including those from Jur and Dinka ethnic groups, as well as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). Over the 36 month period, the project will increase food security in Mvolo, evidenced by an increase in crop production and income levels, improved access to finance through VSLAs, as well as a greater sense of security &amp; cohesion at the community-level.


A sub-project has been funded by DFID in response to the outbreak of Covid-19. The project will deliver interim food relief to 1,500 marginalised and vulnerable households. The objective is the provision of emergency relief until restrictions on migrant workers are relieved, market prices decrease, and households can harvest again. The grant holder has designed a food package using Sphere standards, which will provide rations for a household of 6-9 people for up to eight weeks. As current relief agencies are struggling to bring WASH interventions to rural communities quickly, soap will also be provided for households. The project will provide short-term duration crop seeds, as well as socially distanced agricultural training on how to grow, care for and harvest them. These seeds will provide households with access to nutritious food relatively quickly. Literacy-sensitive learning cards will be developed for short-term duration crops, meaning households with low literacy levels can grow their crops without the need of a Field Officer. Simple foot-pedal water pumps will be supplied to clusters of households with particularly poor water access. Families will be selected based on a rapid needs assessment and in collaboration with traditional leaders, local government, and other agencies. Emergency food relief will be distributed at an accessible point, adhering to social distancing requirements. Alongside these physical interventions, the grant holder will conduct house-to-house awareness raising activities to ensure beneficiaries are prepared and mobilised in way of signs and symptoms, transmission prevention and healthcare provision.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the project are: a) 2,000 rural farmers from will demonstrate improved agronomic practices to reduce their vulnerability by increasing productivity to support household food consumption and income generation. Given that education and literacy levels among adults in Mvolo (and in South Sudan generally) are particularly low, the agricultural training will be practical, hands-on and participatory to maximise comprehension, learning and impact. b) 66 farming groups with a minimum of 30 farmers in each will be formed across 66 villages, bringing together Jur, Dinka and IDPs who have settled in Mvolo to promote collaboration and reduce competition. c) 2,000 rural farmers will develop their basic literacy and numeracy skillsets as the project progresses and specific modules on FAAB, enterprise development and financial literacy will be delivered through FAL sessions delivered at community level. This will support farmers with transition from subsistence farming to income generation. d) 66 farming groups will also operate as VSLAs to increase financial security and further support improved livelihoods. Access to finance, which is currently absent in Mvolo, will support small scale business and enterprise development as well as increased household spending; both of which will contribute to improved quality of life at household level. e) The proposed project will utilise an integrated approach which combines livelihood development with peacebuilding; in recognition of the fact that, in this context, neither will succeed without the other. Peacebuilding activities will be integrated throughout to enhance social cohesion, mitigate the risk of conflict escalation and create an environment conducive to farming activities, income generation and ultimately development. 66 Peace Committees, established in each village, will bring together community leaders and stakeholders (male and female) as leaders in peace promotion. Increased community dialogue will contribute to increased understanding and tolerance amongst different stakeholder groups and increased community participation. Between October 2020 and March 2021, 15,000 marginalised and vulnerable households will receive emergency food relief and short-term duration crop kits to support them through the Covid-19 outbreak.</narrative>
