   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RESILIENCE EMPOWERMENT FOR  CHILDREN OF CONFLICT AFFECTED PEOPLE GROUP IN SAMEE AND PALETWA  TOWNS OF CHIN STATE.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since fighting escalated between Myanmar Military and Arakan Army in 2015, thousand and thousand of village people fled their place, house and work seeking safety and security in nearby towns/villages. As of June 20, 2020, in Myanmar Times, the government estimated that 9000 people are forced to flee their villages for the safety of temporary camp in Paletwa, and some in Samee. Recently two of our staffs based in Paletwa reported to us that residents of over 30 villages have been sheltering at schools and religious buildings in Paletwa and Samee towns after fleeing their home due to conflict. As the new academic year is set to begin on July 21, 2020, many displaced people currently living inside schools have nowhere to go. On the top of that, more than 2000 IDPs children has no classrooms to pursue their education per se. Children who are affected by wars crisis are not only Displaced children but also about 2000 children of the host community because refugee are sheltering inside the school buildings as well as the religious building. The cause of crisis are many as following, (1) fighting, (2) corona virus threat, (3) insufficient basic health care, (4) road block, (5) limited space, etc. Crisis by definition has foreboding implication indicating either despair and hope. Conflicts affected people and the host community are now in a desperate situation as the new academic year is set to begin very soon. Global Family (Family World) field coordinator recently met camps management leaders and said, &quot;there is no room for IDP children in the schools, more schools must be built.&quot; However, well structured permanent school building will take time. Therefore, Global Family will delight to build Temporary Learning Center for displaced children as well as children of the host community. To supply learning materials and portable furniture. More importantly resilience empowerment for hard times to children by teaching them, by protecting them, by keeping them safe and stay healthy.National Ceasefire Agreement is not likely to be achieved soon, the threat of Covid-19 pandemic is also unlikely to be stopped soon, and denial of access to targeted region is likely to be continued. Children of school age need to have sufficient knowledge of resilience for a hard time they are facing. The project includes hiring volunteer teachers for 10 months as well.
As the health component, multivitamin and hand wash soap, mask and hand sanitizer will be provided for each of the student targeted to reach. Hired school nurses will do at least three-time medical examination and will work with volunteer as needed. Nurses are hired for 60 days for each  person. Medical examination for targeted children will done by hired nurses three times per contracted days.  As for township health department linkage, GF will surely in accord with township health department guideline. In the past experience, GF have been a good relationship with them. Thus, two school nurses are hired who have a constant and frequents contacts with township health department and collecting data: ages, gender, number, and cases (if there is specific attention is needed). etc. 

Estimated 3187 displaced children as well as children of the host community are in desperate need of pursuing their education. So, Global Family will target to reach 2169 IDP children (1000 boys and 1169 girls) and 1018 host community children (490 boys and 528 girls) in Samee and Paletwa town.</narrative>
