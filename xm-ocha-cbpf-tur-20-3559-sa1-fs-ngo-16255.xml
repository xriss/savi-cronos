   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the proposed project is to enhance agricultural production, the food, and income-generating opportunities of affected households and communities in southwest Idlib especially among the most vulnerable households and communities. The proposed intervention focus on i) Improve the marketing of wheat products of farmers and support wheat/bread availability in conflict-affected regions ii) Improve the access of small livestock breeders to animal feeders iii) Restore income-generating assets amp increase agricultural production and improved economic conditions and labor market opportunities in the targeted communities. 


Over 6210 households are to be reached throughout the locations targeted by this project. At least 51% of the direct beneficiaries will be women and 5% of people with disabilities. Indirect beneficiaries are estimated at 110,000. Participation will be open to resident farmers, IDPs, and returnees with the exact ratio outlined in the proposal. 


The intervention logic assumes that agricultural development and investment in an improved value chain, in a strategic area such as wheat, can lead to increased food security, and contribute to more resilient livelihoods while equally addressing factors that compel people to migrate by creating employment opportunities, especially for vulnerable people. It is also assumed to reduce the risk of conflicts over resources and contribute to solutions to environmental degradation and climate change. 

The geographical scope of the project focuses on the southwest Idlib governorate. Indicatively the 9 following locations will be targeted: Mhambal, Shagurit, Northern Laj, Maarat Timsrin, Sarmin, Ainata, Hila, Ora Qabli - Edwan, and Acrobat.

The proposed project is building directly on an ongoing EU funded project implemented by WATAN based on mutually reinforcing effects and efficiency of the interventions along the wheat production cycle (please refer to the complementarity and exit strategy sections). It will also integrate the ongoing SCHF project in the same locations, by providing services to host communities and returnees area that is currently available to IDPs only.

Our intervention will be aligned with the wheat crop calendar and improve the purchasing power of 300 households under (output 1.1). 700 tons of wheat seeds and 600 tons of hay will be purchased 280 tons of wheat will be used as seeds for the next season&#x2019;s planting, after sifting and sterilizing by the established seeds bank. The other 420 tons of purchased wheat will be supplied to the contracted mill to be grinded, and, as a result, 336 tons of flour will be obtained and supplied to the bakery established and supported by WATAN. Consequently, bread for 1920 households can be produced and distributed free of charge (output 1.2). The remaining amount (84 tons) is used as bran to be provided along with 600 tons of hay to 2420 livestock breeders as feeders for their animals (output 2.1).

On the other hand, 1400 farmers will benefit from the distribution of wheat inputs, including seeds, fertilizers, pests control materials and harvesting costs, among which 175 farmers will receive TOT and capacity building on wheat crop integrated management through the establishment of 7 farmer field schools in the targeted areas (output 2.2). 

Moreover, 170 cash-for-work workers will be selected to implement activities related to firefighting and integrated pest management (output 2.3).

All these activities will be implemented in line with the &#x201C;Prevention and mitigation measures for COVID-19 on the implementation of agricultural projects&#x201D; that have been developed by WATAN and FSL cluster&#x2019;s partners (please refer to the risk management section).</narrative>
