   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As of the 4th of March 2021, Zimbabwe had 36 223 COVID-19 confirmed cases, 33 632 recoveries and 1483 deaths and as of the 3rd of March there were 146 hospitalised cases. People continue to be infected and affected by COVID-19 on a daily basis. The project therefore seeks to raise awareness to all citizens through different media platforms, national papers, and radio stations.

SOCCOM would like to raise awareness on prevention, stigma and the vaccines and their processes. Working with the Ministry of Health and Child Care, the Health Commission, Caritas and the Education Commission, and also basing on information coming from the United Nations and the World Health Organisation, SOCCOM has discovered that there is need for continuous information on prevention according to the WHO standards, especially the issue of masking up, washing of hands, sanitisation and social distancing. The issue of vaccination is still a bone of contention among many people especially health workers according to the information obtained from hospitals. SOCCOM would therefore like to participate in the promotion of the vaccine. SOCCOM has found out that Coronavirus does not discriminate and everyone needs to be educated and informed about the Covid-19 and its side effects.

Covid-19 does not select and all people need to be equipped with education and information. The role of this project is to protect all people through provision of relevant information at all levels and for all age groups. All people are included in information dissemination through the use of the media available to them. The project is tailor made to include all citizens through the use of different media platforms.</narrative>
