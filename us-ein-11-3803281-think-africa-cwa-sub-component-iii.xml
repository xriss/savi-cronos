   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under this sub-component, ACET will collaborate with the IOs, to undertake a high-level peer review of the CwA process, and particularly the CWA monitoring reports, while providing recommendations for improvement. In light of this, ACET is tasked to develop a review methodology and analysis of self-assessments and preparation, presentation and dissemination of consolidated CWA peer review reports. In March 2019 ACET prepared its bi-annual peer review for presentation to the G20 Africa Advisory Group meeting during the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings. The peer review note focused on operations of, and recommendations for, CwA Compact Team operations. The peer review note benefitted from the February workshops and the Advisory Panel country visits. I n the second quarter, ACET submitted its peer review note to the Africa Advisory Group and presented it during the AAG meeting at the World Bank Spring Meetings. On the 10th April 2010, ACET presented its most recent peer review note to the G20 Africa Advisory Group (AAG) during the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings. The peer review note drew upon two CWA workshops in February organized by ACET and the German Ministry of Finance as well as on the visits to four CwA capitals. During the visits to capitals, members of the CwA Advisory Panel met with senior government officials, development partners and the private sector with the objective to gain a representative view of the successes and challenges of the initiative. The peer review note focused on six key issues that are drawn from the workshops and country visits. These include: &#x2022; A need for all stakeholders to coalesce around the CwA model. &#x2022; A sustained communications and outreach effort. &#x2022; Further refined roles and responsibilities of Compact Teams. &#x2022; Systematic engagement with the private sector. &#x2022; Inclusion of regional integration dimensions for investment. &#x2022; And the need for additional resources for coordination and capacity building. The note emphasized the need to address the value proposition of the CwA and the perceptions, in some cases, of asymmetric expectations. While this needs to be further explored to fully understand the challenges in each country, there is a clear need for a process to enhance the ownership of the initiative by all parties. A second primary issue addressed in the peer review note was communications, marketing and outreach. The CwA is not sufficiently well known or understood &#x2013; not even by those who are supposed to be key stakeholders. There needs to be a &#x201C;promotional campaign&#x201D; around the CwA combined with significantly more public-private dialogue to build awareness. Thirdly, there is a need for additional resources for coordination and for technical assistance. There are a few models whereby this could be realized, of which country windows in existing multi-donor trust funds is likely to be the most cost efficient. in q3, ACET started preparing for the writing of the next coming bi-annual peer review of CwA, due in October 2019. In q4, ACET finalized its second peer review in October 2019. The note intends to complement the assessment of progress under the Compact with Africa (CwA), particularly regarding cross border flows, engagement of Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and the roles and responsibilities of the International Organizations (IOs).


For Q2 2020:
ACET&#x2019;s 4th peer review note was discussed at the G20 Africa Advisory Group meeting in May. The note has also been included in the CwA monitoring report. The peer review focused on key policy issues facing CwA countries in the context of the pandemic crisis, including policy and advocacy that can help ensure a strong economic rebound</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project objective is for ACET to provide an independent, light-touch review of the CWA monitoring process that provides all CWA stakeholders insights into progress and possible options for improvements. In Q1, the ACET AAG draft peer review note was developed. The G20 AAG meeting has however been postponed to end-May due to the inability of the World Bank and AfDB to focus on the AAG report amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This implies that the ACET Peer Review note will also be delayed until end of May as it is based in part on the IO monitoring report.</narrative>
