   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi-sectoral assistance for  Adele/Golbo IDPs sites in Lagahidha district, East Bale zone, Oromia region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention will provide multi-sectoral health, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) and non-food items (NFI) assistance to a total of 1,889 households (HHs) and 10,088 persons (5,810M, 4278F) in the Golbo/Adele IDP site of Lagahidha woreda in East Bale Zone, Oromia region. There are 9,894 internally displaced persons (IDPs) (5,699M, 4195F) in both sites affected by the inter-communal conflict between Somali and Oromia regions since September 2017. 
The 2020 Ethiopian Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) indicate that over one third of people in need face multiple challenges and have multiple needs Among those living in the woreda,  33% are are with high severity of needs and 4% with very high severity of needs. Laga Hidha is among these woredas with the most severe and compounded needs. UNOCHA&#x2019;s Multi-sectoral COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Plan 2020 also highlights that IDPs in 56 sites including those in Lagahidha woreda live in overcrowded settings (making social distancing nearly impossible) with inadequate hygiene facilities and lack of access to health services.

The Shelter/NFI Cluster targets to reach 2.3 million IDPs, returnees, affected host communities, deportees and migrants, with emphasis on a child and female-headed households, the elderly, separated children, people with disabilities and households at greater risk of illness. In the COVID-19 context, the Cluster prioritizes collective, spontaneous and planned sites where people are at high risk of morbidity due to overcrowding limited access to healthcare and public health communications, hygiene and sanitation facilities poor nutrition and reliance upon distributions involving large gatherings. Hence, shelter/ NFI will focus on the decongestion of overcrowded shelters and non-partitioned communal living spaces by expanding spontaneous/planned sites, establishing new emergency shelters, refurbishing collective centers, and constructing partitions for single-room shelters shared by multiple families. Accordingly, this project will provide Core Relief Items including WASH NFI, in kind NFI (due the unfeasible of market for cash), Emergency Shelter Repair Kits (ESRK) in targeted IDP sites. 
Further, most of the collective IDP sites are accessing inadequate WASH services of less than 7.5 liters/person/day. The IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Round 21 indicated that the 25 WASH-priority IDPs sites are those with a population of 4,000 or more where HHs only have one to two jerry cans/buckets (20L) of water collected per HH per day.. IDP sites, especially collective centers and spontaneous settlements, where households frequently share communal living, cooking, and WASH facilities, and where water availability is well below the Sphere standard. This will be of primary concern to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The IRC will provide additional water points in Adele and water trucking for IDP communities who are located 12 Kms away from Adele water points. The IRC will also rehabilitate semi-permanent shared communal sanitation facilities provide the basics of life-saving Shelter/NFIs such as Corrugated Galvanized Iron sheet (CGIs), nails, materials for constructing wall and fixtures, and cash (labor cost and local materials) and Core Relief Items/NFIs like bedding, kitchen, mosquito net, and hygiene sets. The IRC will also provide primary health care (PHC) services using surge support strengthen disease surveillance systems, including PHEM and equip health facilities with routine drugs, medical supplies and infection prevention materials. 

Overall, the project aims to improve the protection and health of IDPs in the targeted sites through an integrated shelter/NFI, WASH, and health, activities, including protection mainstreaming and addressing Housing and Land Property (HLP) issues in coordination with the HLP working group and clusters in the targeted sites.</narrative>
