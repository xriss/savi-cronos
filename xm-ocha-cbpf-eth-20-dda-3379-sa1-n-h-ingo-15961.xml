   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-Saving Emergency Health and Nutrition Response in three disaster-affected communities in East and West Hararghe Zone, of Oromia Region (Melka Belo,  Goro Muti, Habro)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">n alignment with the EHF 2020 strategic allocation document, World Vision designed this integrated multi-sector project to respond to the emergency needs of the people in the prioritized hot spot districts of Ethiopia. World Vison Ethiopia proposes integrated emergency health and nutrition response in Oromia national regional states to address the critical needs of vulnerable populations through the funding opportunity from EHF 2020. WVE intends to implement a minimum multi-sector response package of Health, and nutrition in Goro Muti, Melka Belo and Habro woredas of East and West Hararghe Zones. The selection of the districts is based on hotspot priority of the nutrition and health clusters and responses are designed based on rapid assessments conducted in the districts after the release of the EHF2020 where these targeted woredas are confirmed to have a higher number of SAM admissions of children (annual SAM admission exceeds 1000 across the districts) and high incidence of measles and/ or high incidence of cholera and the districts are also pressured with the presence of IDPs.
Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, needs across health and nutrition are expected to increase as movement is restricted, livelihood opportunities decrease, and prices of food and basic necessities inflate. Effective emergency response requires the implementation of integrated response program among multiple sectors at both the facility and community levels in order to maximize the desired impact.


The health system will be supported to detect and treat sick children, women amp men and the nutrition interventions will continue to target malnourished children, children in need of Infant and Young Child Feeding practices support, and malnourished pregnant and lactating women in order to build their immune response to diseases, including COVID-19 

The overall objectives of initiating these project is to provide timely access to live-saving quality treatment of acute malnutrition and health response among children under 5 (CU5) and pregnant and lactating women. In addition, to strengthen the capacity of Woreda Health Offices (WHOs) to treat and manage ICCM/IMNCI, the health workers will be equipped with acute malnutrition and improved infant and young child feeding in emergencies (IYCF-E) knowledge and practices of Mothers with children lt 2 years. 
Over a period of six months, WV will provide technical and operational support to the woreda health offices, ensuring the delivery of full CMAM/IMAM packages by strengthening the continuum of care for SAM-MAM case management in health facilities promoting optimal infant and young child feeding in emergencies (IYCF-E) and strengthening early malnutrition case detection and referrals. The target beneficiaries will be the most vulnerable under-five children and PLW.
World Vision Ethiopia will implement integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition (IMAM) response including TSFP in the five-targeted districts. As disease outbreak and COVID-19 is leading to severe acute malnutrition, World Vision will incorporate health components in Melka Belo, Goro Guti and Habro woredas and will implement COVID-19 response and prevention strategies in all targeted Woredas. As a result of this integrated intervention, 41244 individuals (5763 men, 15451 women, 9815 boys and 10215 girls) will benefit from different project components.</narrative>
