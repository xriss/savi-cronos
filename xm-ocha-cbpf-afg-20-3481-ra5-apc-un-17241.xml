   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to vulnerable households through distribution of cash for protection in Afghanistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNHCR will distribute cash assistance AFN 15,500 (approx. USD 195 per family)  to 1,400 protection-vulnerable households among IDPs, returnees and host communities impacted by COVID-19 in Afghanistan. This is in response to the needs outlined in section 1 which shows the precarious protection situation of the people in Afghanistan due to COVID-19, exacerbating the already difficult social and economic conditions. Beneficiaries will be selected using existing data. Over the past three years, UNHCR has conducted in-person vulnerability/needs assessments for persons of concern for different cash-based programmes including cash for shelter, support to persons with specific needs, winterization, among others. The vulnerability profile of these former cash recipients is consolidated and maintained by UNHCR. Given the current circumstances where in person or household visits are not feasible, beneficiaries will primarily be selected through a desk review followed by data validation. In identifying the target group for this activity, UNHCR analyzed this data and pre-selected those who met the categorical selection criteria for a phone-based validation interview (conducted by a partner) to verify their basic biodata and presence in the country. The validation of the beneficiary details is carried out by Women for Afghan Women (WAW), Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (CHA), Organization of Human Welfare (OHW) and BEST, all of whom have existing partnership agreements with UNHCR. The AHF-funded activity will be incorporated into the work of the UNHCR sub offices and staff to ensure the implementation All households with specific profiles were scored as per the categorical selection criteria. Households were assigned a score of one (1) for each risk/vulnerability profile one (1) for not receiving any assistance.  Each household&#x2019;s score was aggregated and ranked in order of priority. This modality was due to limitations in conducting face-to-face interviews, related efficiencies in utilizing existing data and avoiding respondent fatigue, good practices in targeting approaches during pandemics, and existing literature on groups most impacted by COVID-19. The cash is delivered by a Money Service Provider (MSP). UNHCR has ongoing cash-based programmes targeted for a cross-section of populations-in-need and existing distribution sites across the country, with COVID-19 specific mitigation measures, will be utilized. Transmission of COVID-19 at distribution sites is mitigated by several actions ex: distributing cash in secure locations, organizing distribution into smaller distributions over several days, distributing cash in envelops, provision of facilities for handwashing and wearing PPE.  UNHCR is responsible for disseminating information on the amounts, frequency, distribution points, dates and times for payments through phone calls and existing community leadership structures. UNHCR staff will be present during the distribution. Should the security situation and other restrictions limit UNHCR staff from being present during the distributions, the same will be monitored remotely by phone, and partner staff will be physically be present to witness the distribution. During the distribution, when cash is handed out, the recipient will be provided a brief awareness session including information regarding the complaints mechanism. Please refer to section 6 for more details. UNHCR has mobilized community support and involved local authorities in the design and delivery of the programme. This ensures adequate understanding of the programme as well as necessary measures are in place to safeguard both programme recipients and humanitarian staff. UNHCR also utilizes secure distribution sites to deliver the cash assistance to beneficiaries. Moreover, complaint mechanisms are in place to continuously raise awareness of the programme to both recipients and non-recipients, and to review any valid comments or concerns, before escalating to conflict.</narrative>
