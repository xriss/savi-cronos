   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development supports community development programs in Liberia through the Episcopal Church of Liberia&#x2019;s Health and Development Office and in Sierra Leone through the Anglican Diocese of Bo&#x2019;s Integrated Development Program. Both country programs include NetsforLife malaria prevention &amp;amp; control; food security; sexual &amp;amp; gender-based violence prevention &amp;amp; response; livelihood strengthening; and micro-savings projects. 

Currently, our Ebola response efforts are implemented with these Anglican Church partners, who coordinate with their respective government bodies &#x2013; in Sierra Leone the District Health Management Task Force and in Liberia, the National Ebola Task Force.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Liberia, our Ebola emergency response activities include:

(1) Distribution of over 10,000 flyers, pamphlets and bumper stickers with key messaging to Trinity Cathedral Episcopal, St. Thomas Episcopal, St. Stephen Episcopal, another St. Thomas Episcopal, Assembly of God Mission, Presbyterian Cathedral, Jubilee Christian fellowship, First United Methodist, Providence Baptist, Cavalry Baptist, Philadelphia Cathedral, and Sacred Heart Catholic Cathedral. 

(2) Provision of protective gear (e.g. nose masks, goggles, medical gowns, aprons, gloves and thermometers) to three hospitals - Redemption, C.H.  Rennie and Phoebe Hospitals - in Montserrado County. A faster delivery of these items was made possible by procuring and shipping consignments through the Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development Ghana Regional Office.

(3) Ebola prevention and response messages using local radio broadcasting agencies in 8 counties - Bong, Lofa, Cape Mount, Sinoe, Grand Bassah , Montserrado, Rivercess and Magribi Counties - in a number of local languages and dialects.

(4) Distribution of emergency food packages and sanitary equipment (e.g. chlorine detergent and larger buckets with taps for hand washing) for 500 people in quarantined communities located in New Plateau Town, Sinje, Sanoyea and Jabdumum villages in Bong County. Packages also include posters with key messaging on basic hygiene practices for households to paste on their walls.

(5) Two consignments of personal protection equipment have been shipped from the Ghana Regional Office. Food distribution to 150 quarantined households in Cape Mount County has also been carried out together with the distribution of sanitary items (e.g. buckets, chlorine and bleach) and educational posters.

In Sierra Leone, our Ebola emergency response activities include:

(1) Training of trainers for Diocese health and development staff on case detection and management, who then trained 54 community volunteers (e.g. malaria control agents from on-going health programs, priests and local village leaders). The volunteers, equipped with protective gear and medical equipment, have referred suspected cases to health services, carried out tracing work and provided ebola awareness and counseling to families. Information on the referral pathway (i.e. where to go for different services), telephone numbers and other contact details are posted on village centers and homes.

(2) Sensitization and education on prevention methods in five districts by volunteers, priests, field project staff community stakeholders through radio and panel discussions and public rallies. The Anglican Diocese of Bo has reached  an estimated 150,000 people, which constitutes the general populace of the five districts.

(3) Provision of sanitary supplies (e.g. chlorine, buckets with taps, detergents, gloves, sanitizers, masks and bowls) to quarantined communities from the five districts.

(4) Distribution of food items (e.g. oil, rice, canned fish and meat) in preparation for the three-day country-wide lockdown to a total of 978 families (out of which 205 are women headed families, 161 survivor families, 28 child headed families and 584 destitute families (i.e. the sick and the elderly)).

(5) Distribution of medical equipment and sanitary materials from Episcopal Relief &amp;amp; Development&#x2019;s Ghana Regional Office have been shipped on two occasions to health facilities in Bo.</narrative>
