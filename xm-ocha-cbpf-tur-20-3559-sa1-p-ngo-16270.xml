   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Continuation of the provision of Integrated Protection and Legal Services to IDPs and Host Community members through a community center in Afrin District, Aleppo Governorate, and Jisr Ash Shugur District, Idleb Governorate in Northwest Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to continue providing the integrated GBV and legal assistance services in the already existing two Community Centers that are funded by the UN/IOM and run by Hope Revival Organization (HRO) until the end of June 2020 in Darkoush community/Idleb, and Afrin community/Aleppo.  
SADA Organization (Prime applicant), in partnership with HRO (Sub-applicant), will share the responsibilities and follow a protection-centered and community-based approach to ensure that a greater number of Syrians have safe access to these services and their protection risks and vulnerability is further reduced. 

The community center aims to provide a space where men, women, boys, and girls can socialize and strengthen previously fractured social networks, gain access to specialized protection services including GBV case management, obtain specialized information/legal support on Civil Status Documentation (CSD)/Housing Land and Property (HLP), and receive information on services available in the wider area. 
SADAD will target men, women, girls, and boys including most vulnerable ones, inside and outside WGSS in CCs in the two locations with GBV awareness-raising sessions (entry point to identify protection cases, risks, and needs), life skills, vocational training, and free space activities including recreational and handcraft activities, to strengthen social inclusion and enhance prevention of negative social norms that underpin the normalization of GBV.

While HRO will provide GBV Case Management, GBV Young Mother Club services, in addition to capacity building for GBV project staff and for frontline humanitarian workers including health staff on GBV related issues to empower the community members and enable them effectively contribute to the prevention and response to GBV issues. Dissemination of key messages on COVID-19 will always be considered in project sessions. 
 To ensure the staff well-being and alleviate the stress, burnout, and anxiety produced by the outbreak of coronavirus. And as a specialized organization in MHPSS. HRO will support the project staff in Turkey and Syria with regular physical or remote self/staff-care sessions by specialized focal point.
The two centers are located in safe and accessible locations. Activities are designed based on identified needs considering culture, context, age of beneficiaries. 
Coordination at the field and central level will be closely followed by SADAD and HRO to ensure the effective engagement of community members in project activities and that the project is smoothly progressing.
Each partner will monitor and evaluate its activities by one MampE focal point who will coordinate with the MampE managers in Turkey, using MampE toolkits developed by GBV SC. Moreover, HRO will rely on Protection Cluster recommendations while monitoring the legal services and activities. The project manager/SADAD and project officer/HRO, in Turkey, will supervise and follow up on the day-to-day performance of field teams, work plans, safety and security measures and actions, HR, procurement, and finance-related tasks in coordination with the concern departments and with project field coordinators. SADAD and HRO program managers (in Turkey) will facilitate and lead the monthly review meetings to ensure that the project is on the right track in line with the overall objective, scope of work, timeline, and budget.
