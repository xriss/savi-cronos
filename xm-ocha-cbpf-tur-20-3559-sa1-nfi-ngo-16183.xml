As for the beneficiaries, WATAN already conducted a need assessment and a 100% verification including a specific scoring system that can identify the targeted groups of this project, meanwhile, the provided support will keep seeking to support the shelter capacity and to seek longer-term solutions that can be provided to the affected groups by reallocation households from the camps to the rehabilitated collective centres as well.

The technical needs will be assessed through specialist teams consists of engineers and technicians, and based on their findings, the fund will be allocated to fill the gaps of lacking the basic needs. Bill of quantities will be prepared accordingly, and the implementation will go through contractual services after a tight bidding process.
