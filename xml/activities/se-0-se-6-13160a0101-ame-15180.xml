   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
UNFPA is applying for support from Sida for a program delivering reproductive health, promoting sexual and reproductive health, preventing and adressing gender-based violence in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey in 2019-2020. The application covers SEK 120,000,000 distributed over 2 years, SEK 60,000,000 each for 2019 and 2020. The objectives of the program are as follows:

1. Increase the availability of and access to specialized reproductive health and gender-based violence services;
2. Increase the social safety nets for women and girls and youth;
3. Challenge negative social norms that limit the empowerment of women and girls;
4. Ensure a coordinated and integrated multi-sectoral gender-based violence response in the impacted area.

The program is implemented by UNFPA&apos;s local offices in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, in collaboration with a large number of implementing partners. UNFPA&apos;s regional office in Cairo is Sida&apos;s agreement partner. Sida has previously provided support to UNFPA for a similar program with positive experiences.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNFPA is delivering unique and considerable GBV and SHRH services that are very much needed and that would not be available at all if they were not supported by donors like Sweden, especially in Syria. Financial barriers in Lebanon and Jordan to access alternative services in the private sector are too high for refugees and most vulnerable people in these countries. The public sector is not shaped for addresing the large demand, especially for refugee populations. In Turkey, similar vulnerable groups may have a better access to stronger public sector services, but at a lower quality than that offered by UNFPA and its partners. UNFPA/Damascus reports that the provision of GBV services was supported in 6 Women and Girls Safe Spaces (WGSSs) and 11 GBV mobile teams. 62,543 women and girls received GBV services (case management, psychosocial support (PSS), GBV awareness raising, referral to specialized services, and vocational and literacy training sessions), 2 new WGSSs were established, 1 in Aleppo and 1 in Deir-ez-Zor. In addition, provision of services was made through 4 WGSS: 1 in Daraa and 3 in Rural Damascus. A total of 347,398 SRH services were provided through four static clinics, eleven medical points, and two mobile teams in 10 governorates during the third quarter of 2019. 10,400 Female Dignity Kits were distributed, including in North East Syria, in Al Hol camp and in North West Syria (cross-line). UNFPA established 3 Community Well-being Centres and 1 Family Planning Unit (Lattaqia, Aleppo, rural Damascus) that provided 9,724 beneficiaries with GBV and SRHR services. UNFPA works through 7 local partners. It is a breakthrough that UNFPA could open a sub-office in Deir ez Zoor in 2019, operating a WGSS and a youth centre there through partners. A national campaign uplifting people living with disabilities&apos; differences and creative capacities was implemented and the newly establihed national observatory for GBV started training key stakeholders. UNFPA conducted regular trainings on case management and developed the national gender plan. The delay in getting administrative approvals from government entities, the changing security situation on the ground, and the difficulties in finding well-trained service providers in targeted locations were the main challenges. Capacity-building is reinforced. UNFPA Turkey Cross-Border (XB) supported the continuation of service provision in one maternity hospital in Idleb governorate, North West Syria, reaching 24,256 women, girls, men, and boys with essential SRH services such as ante- and post natal care, deliveries, and family planning. This hospital addressed emerging health needs and high demand for obstetrical care during acute forced displacements. GBV case management assisted 28 disclosed cases in 2019 last quarter. 869 married adolescent girls were supported with life skills and critical information on SRH for themselves and their newborn babies through the approach Adolescent Mothers Against All Odds. UNFPA trained 25 service providers on adolescent health programming and established Young Mothers&apos; Clubs. The deterioration of the security situation, coupled with a significant influx of newly displaced, was the main challenge. Partners successfully managed to respond to the emergency through effective outreach mobilization. Capacities for case management of rape were increased, due to higher incidence data. Third party monitors&apos; reports and audits are positive on the performance. No fraud was identified. Beneficiaries&apos; surveys are showing high level of satisfaction. UNFPA/Jordan provided safe and confidential access to non-stigmatising GBV response and prevention services to 6,622 individuals, including access to case management services, referrals, PSS, awareness-raising, counselling, and provision of GBV services in Sweileh, East Amman, Deir Alla, Madaba, Karak, and Zarqa. 6 Sida-supported safe spaces were established and continue to provide a place for women to access confidential services. Case management services were provided to 456 GBV survivors, 48% Syrians. 3,211 beneficiaries benefited from awareness-raising sessions on GBV. 1,922 women and girls have benefited from empowerment and recreational activities. 126 women and girls who self-identify as People with Disabilities were reached through awareness, recreational, and empowerment activities - a 15-fold increase from the previous period. The National Council for Family Affairs (NCFA) launched the guidelines to address cases of GBV and Child Protection together with UNFPA, UNICEF and UNHCR and trained partners to use them. 196 young women and men participated in awareness-raising sessions, including the physical and psychological changes associated with puberty, GBV, SRH, HIV/AIDS, STIs, and family planning methods. UNFPA/Lebanon did not met results according to expectations during the reported period due to disruptions caused by social unrest in Lebanon, but first of all because it lost most of its programme workforce during that year and could not replace them timely. It started the renewed recruitment process of the 10 implementating partners for the programme, still ongoing currently. It adapted to the Lebanese context programme tools such as the essential service package for women and girls subject to violence, the needs assessment toolkit on GBV/RH for social workers and women peer educators, the RH/GBV integrated service package, and the Reproductive Health manual for adolescent girls and service providers. UNFPA/Turkey supported 5 Women and Girls Safe Spaces in Istanbul (Bayrampasa), in Hatay (Antakya and Reyhanli), in Sanliurfa (Devtesti) and in Diyarbakir (Yenisehir),with Sida&apos;s funding out of its 34 facilities throughout the country where delivered services to Syrian, Turkish nationals and other groups include physical examinations, ante- and post-natal care, family planning counselling and commodities, awareness raising on SRH and GBV issues, women&#x2019;s empowerment activities (including language courses, vocational training, and recreational activities), individual and group counselling, PSS for GBV survivors, and referrals. Empowerment activities were added in 25 ECHO funded WGSS with Sida&apos;s support. 19,947 beneficiaries received SRH services, 17,143 women and girls received GBV services, 10,141 persons were empowered on SRH and GBV issues through 3 implementing partners. The Regional Syria Response Hub has continued to lead the coordination of Information Management on GBV and reproductive health for UNFPA Whole of Syria as well as the Whole of Syria GBV Area of Responsibility. It produced Information Management items such as: Whole of Syria Social Inclusion Data Plan, UNFPA Whole of Syria Reproductive Health Dashboard and GBV Dashboard, and Whole of Syria Multisectoral needs analysis for GBV. Information managers for humanitarian action in the Whole of Syria were trained on social inclusion in data management. It launched To Do No Harm, a training and awareness video targeting journalists reporting on GBV and its second regional media consultation on the principles and ethics of reporting on GBV. The 16 day campaign &apos;Striking At The Root&apos; gathered 45 social media activists and reporters from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Iraq to tackle the issue of unprofessional and potentially harmful reporting practices among some media outlets in the region, in addition to discussing potential action points to mobilise far-reaching change throughout the media industry. UNFPA produced a publication, Unbroken, that shed light on challenges adolescent girls face, but also highlighted their hopes, aspirations, and courage. The hub advocacy initiatives, guidelines and publications are making a difference.</narrative>
