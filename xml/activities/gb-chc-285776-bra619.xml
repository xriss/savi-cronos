  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Brazil is in a second wave of COVID-19 with the highest number of weekly cases since mid-August with 6.6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 (6,603,540) and 176,941 deaths, the 2nd highest number of deaths in the world. Isolated indigenous groups living in the Brazilian Amazon are among the most vulnerable, due to lack of access to adequate health care and low immunity to external diseases.

This project aims to: a) decrease the risk of COVID-19 of isolated indigenous groups in TIY (Yanomami Territory) in the Amazon by avoiding travel outside their communities and improve nutrition and life conditions, through the distribution of food, tools and clothing; and b) ensure access to education, healthcare, and the means to communicate threats (via radio) within their communities via guaranteeing access to solar energy systems in schools, health posts and radio, to support self-sustainable living and avoid external exposure to COVID-19. It intends to reach a total of 3,574 people from 31 communities located in the Auaris region, of which 26 communities (2,961 people) are San&#xF6;ma, and 5 are Ye&#xB4;kuana, reaching 613 people. 

The main activities are: a) the distribution of food/non-food/hygiene kits to 31 communities located in Auaris, and the installation of 5 solar panels in 5 communities - 3 Sanoma communities: Kalisi, Kolulu and Polasai, and 2 Ye&apos;kuana communities: Fuduuwaduinha e Kuratanha. The Auaris region was chosen because it is the region in Yanomami Territory with the highest demographic density, with more than 3,500 people registering only 9 cases of community transmission of COVID-19, the other 63 cases were in health units in Boa Vista, the majority of cases registered by DSEI-YY on 13/11/20 occurred at CASAI - Indigenous Health Unit in Boa Vista. The installation of solar panels will supply clean energy in community spaces far away from the main landing strip where the Brazilian army barracks are located and the risk of infection with COVID-19 is higher.</narrative>
