   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support for Improved Immediate Access to Food for Vulnerable Households in Galkayo South, Mudug Region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The planned FSL project intervention is cluster specific response that conforms to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2021 and the 1st 2021 SHF Standard Allocation for Food Security and Livelihoods that will respond to acute water shortages in Galkayo South (Mudug region), which are experiencing pre-drought conditions.

The Project will improve immediate access to food while restoring livelihoods related to food and income sources that have been impacted by water shortages occasioned by pre-drought conditions, conflicts and impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The Project targets an estimated 706HH (4,236 people) assessed to be in acute food insecurity, &#x2018;Crisis&#x2019; and &#x2018;Emergency&#x2019; phases of IPC (3 and 4) by providing them with a means to sustained access to food and water support. The project will undertake Conditional Cash Transfer for 662 unskilled labourers and 44 semi-skilled labourers rehabilitating 9 Water Pans in 9 settlements in Galkayo South. Each of the 662 unskilled labourers shall get $6 per day while each of the 44 semi-skilled labourers will work at the rate of $8 per day:- Daily work output per person per day as per the Somalia CWG standards is 1.585M3 ( 5hours* 0.317M3). The total number of working days is 25 for each water pan, However, they will be rehabilitated in different months to allow for prudent supervision, monitoring and evaluation and reporting by the project team. The nine water pans to be rehabilitated are 1. Gaarcad, 2. Dhagfaruuryaale, 3. Cinjirre, 4. Laamawayne, 5. Rasan, 6. Balicadde, 7. Xaarxaar, 8. Qooraseyn, 9.Biyogaduud.

The project will specifically prioritise destitute pastoralists and IDP households, women from the destitute households left behind in identified accessible settlements (hard to reach areas especially such as rural areas of the four Districts). The planned project activities will help mitigate the effects of the poor October to December 2020 Deyr rains and Desert locust infestation leading to inadequate pasture, water resources and below-average crop production in Central Somalia Region. 

The project will provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and emerging gaps that will require a humanitarian response. This is particularly necessary given the prediction of a possible below-average rainfall for the coming Gu 2021 season as indicated by FEWSNET/FSNAU in its February to September 2021 update. 

The project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries, ensuring the resultant benefits of the project accrue to them. The project will also ensure there is adequate protection of women in all the venues and staging points of the project activities to ensure it provides women the safety and protection required. Covid-19 preventive measures and health guidelines will also be mainstreamed in the project implementation. 

CPD plans to use the first 2 months of the project to undertake household vulnerability assessment in the identified locations within South Mudug, undertake community engagement, beneficiary selection, verification and registration for the Conditional Cash Transfers beneficiaries captured in KoboConnect. The beneficiary selection will be done through a Community-Based Target process (CBT) as recommended by the Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG). The rehabilitation works involving excavation of water pans to required provided dimensions will be done across 3 months for the 9 sites in Galkayo South of Mudug region. Payments to the unskilled and semi-skilled labourers will be made through Mobile Money Transfer once the scheduled work is completed. The project will carry out post-distribution monitoring in the final month of the project.</narrative>
