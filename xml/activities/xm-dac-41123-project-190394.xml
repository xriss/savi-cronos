   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya Vision 2030, the long-term development blueprint that aims to transform the country into an industrialized upper middle-income country, offering a high quality of life to all its citizens, and Kenya Industrial Transformation Programme (KITP), guide Kenya development initiatives.
The Vision 2030 is implemented through successive five-year medium term plans.  The country is now implementing the third Medium Term Plan (MTP III) 2018-2022. Like for its two predecessors, the long-term development strategy, Big Four Development Agenda and other national development policies guide MTP III.  It is guided by the Constitution of Kenya approved in 2010 and incorporates the priorities outlined in the Manifesto of the ruling Political Party &#x201C;Agenda for Kenya 2013-2017 and Beyond.&#x201D;
MTP III builds on the achievements of the first and second MTPs and prioritizes implementation of the &#x201C;Big Four Agenda&#x201D; initiatives. The initiatives focus on increasing the manufacturing share of GDP from 9.2 %to 15% and agro-processing to at least 50% of total agricultural output, providing affordable housing by building 500,000 affordable houses across the country, enhancing Food and Nutrition Security through construction of large-scale multi-purpose and smaller dams for irrigation projects, construction of food storage facilities and implementation of high impact nutritional interventions, as well as achieving 100% Universal Health Coverage. Additionally, the Plan targets to improve Kenya&#x2019;s ranking in the Ease of Doing Business Indicator from position 80 to 45 (at least below 50) out of 189 and attracting increased and sustainable Foreign Direct Investment inflows from the current USD 1.3b to USD 3.8b . The MTP III has facilitated mainstreaming and continued implementation to develop projects that contribute to the achievements of Sustainable Development Goals, as outlined in Agenda 2030. The Plan is further, aligned to the Africa Union&#x2019;s Agenda 2063, which constitutes the strategic framework for socio-economic transformation of the continent by 2063.
To achieve the aforementioned goals, the Government aims at facilitating growth of the manufacturing sector by developing the necessary infrastructure for sustainable inclusive industrial development. One of the vehicles, which the Government decided to adopt and use is the UNIDO Programme for Country Partnerships (PCP) model, to accelerate inclusive sustainable industrial development (ISID) in Kenya, taking into account the principle of &#x2018;&#x2018;leaving no-one behind&#x2019;&#x2019;.
Results from successful implementation of PCP in Ethiopia, Senegal and Peru confirm that the Programme can significantly transform the economy of a country by improving the living standards of the people (food, education, shelter, health, etc.) out of their earnings from jobs created, enhance the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and reduce the vulnerability and reliance on the agricultural sector for jobs creation and export earnings. PCP Kenya is designed, developed and will be implemented taking into account lessons learned and the best practices identified in previous PCPs.
The PCP model has five main features:
  Government ownership at the highest political level;
  Clear consideration of the objectives of UNIDO ISID;
  Alignment with national industrialization priorities and national development plans;
  Focus on industrial sectors and priority intervention areas;
  Multi-stakeholder partnership and joint resource mobilization.
The 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights the need to work in multi-stakeholder partnership to mobilize the knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources needed to achieve the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As such, the PCP supports a long-term development process, contributing to the achievement of SDG9 &quot;Building resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation&quot;, and other relevant SDGs, such as SDG 7 &quot;Affordable and Clean Energy&quot;, SDG 5 &quot;Gender Equality&quot;, SDG 17 &quot;Partnerships for the Goals&quot;. The SDG 17 is specifically intended to call on the international community to &quot;strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development&quot;. The PCP proposes a systemic partnership model that will leverage stakeholders and resources to amplify the impact of UNIDO interventions.
The PCP is also tailored to fulfil the needs of the country and aligned to the objectives of Kenya Vision 2030. The Programme for Country Partnership in Kenya has been formulated with a new development model, the self-starter approach that involves the national counterparts in a pro-active collaboration across the full PCP cycle, from conception to programming and further to implementation and monitoring. It has been programmed and will be implemented as part of a broad process of consultation and collaboration with the Government, the private sector and other local and international stakeholders.
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, MSMEs, the enterprise size most diffused in the country, have been particularly affected in the country in terms of lack of financial liquidity, disruption of supply, drop of revenues and increase in layoffs. Industry has been one of the first economic sectors hit by the lockdowns in Kenya and, if not properly assisted, would probably be the last to recover in terms of business and operations. The PCP will then operate immediately to mitigate the negative effects of the downturn and further mainstream COVID-19 recovery interventions across the PCP during the all duration of implementation.
Following the outlining of a country context and taking into considerations the most urgent needs to curb COVID-19 impact on manufacturing and with overall priority focus on MSMEs, the PCP counterpart in accordance with the self-starter approach, has identified PCP main focus areas of intervention, priority sectors and service enablers.
As a result, of the self-assessment, PCP components were identified as follows:
  Industrial Policy and Governance;
  Agro-processing, including leather and textile;
  Trade and Investment Promotion;
  Green Industry;
  Industrial Zones;
  ICT and Digitalization;
  Blue Economy;
  Women &amp; Youth Empowerment.

Key cross-cutting issues, such as devolution and gender, will be mainstreamed into the relevant programme components, which will be supported by multi-stakeholder partnerships, with emphasis on South-South and Triangular Cooperation.
The established PCP National Coordination mechanisms are fully aligned to country existing institutional arrangements on governance for development.
The National Development Implementation and Communication Cabinet Committee (NDICCC), established by H.E. the President of Kenya in 2019 to oversee implementation of government development programmes and projects, will steer PCP implementation.
A number of synergies will be established with UN agencies, starting from aligning the PCP to the ongoing UNDAF Kenya (2018-2022). It is foreseen that the PCP will critically contribute to upscale joint and integrated UN operations in Kenya and increase UNIDO&#x2019;s portfolio.
Closer synergies have been also established with the Private Sector in Kenya. Since 2007, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) - the multilateral non-binding pact to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies - has launched its local network in Kenya. The private sector network, accounting for 194 members, is in partnership with leading private business organizations in Kenya, such as Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM), Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) &amp; Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE).
The Kenya Association of Manufacturers is currently hosting UNGC Kenya Secretariat.  UNIDO and the UN Global Compact Kenya will explore closer cooperation through the Programme for Country Partnership (PCP) to advance in the achievement of SDG9 and more UN Sustainable Development Goals, while also contributing to achieve business growth.
Partnerships events have been organized in 2020 by the national stakeholders to promote PCP Kenya to international donors with the intent of taking stock of relevant ongoing support and strategizing with partners on consolidation of efforts to upscale impact, through broader outreach and policy mainstreaming. As a result, international partners have expressed their full support to PCP development, upon signature of the Programme document by H.E. the President of Kenya and UNIDO Director General.</narrative>
