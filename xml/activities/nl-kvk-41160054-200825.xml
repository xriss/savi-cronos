   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to John Hopkins University data, as of 1 October 2020, there have been 33, 997, 825 confirmed cases and 1,014,588  deaths worldwide.  As the pandemic develops, countries with weaker health systems, limited capacity to deal with major outbreaks, and large populations of already vulnerable communities are at particular risk; this includes Afghanistan.

In Afghanistan, as of 29 September 2020, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) reported that 39,285 people across all 34 provinces have tested positive for COVID-19. Kabul is the epicentre of the outbreak; Herat, Kandahar, and Balkh provinces closely follow (1,458 individuals are confirmed to have died from the virus ). The relatively low level of infection, especially juxtaposed with the high number of Afghans who have returned from Iran and Pakistan in recent months, can be attributed to low community-testing and slow processing of test results &#x2013; especially for those in rural, remote and insecure areas. Tellingly, while the number of reported positive cases has dropped, the rate of death has risen.  There are currently 11 testing laboratories in the country; the government hopes to eventually have 15 operational.  The graph below presents the breakdown of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Afghanistan</narrative>
