Output 2: New sustainable development solutions will be scaled at country level as part of UNDP&#x2019;s country programme and operations, national policy and/or local markets. 

2.1 At least 6 blogs or other (substantial) media posts published per year.
2.2 At least 50% of our learning challenges have the public sector as counterpart
2.3 At least one government entity has adopted an accelerator lab method.
2.4 At least 50% of our learning challenges are providing actionable knowledge to ongoing CO projects.

Output 3: A core global level result will be that a global learning and scaling network is established and functioning.

3.1 The lab interacts at least once a week with another lab in the network (48 interaction per year)

3.2 5% of information shared across the network should be methodology, or sustainable development issue and opportunity related.

3.3 The Accelerator Lab Networks&apos; work is featured at least 3 times per month in Country Office Social Media channels and tag UNDP Accelerator Labs accounts. The Lab team engages at least once a month across any social media conversation related to the work of the Accelerator Lab Network, from either personal or CO account.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.1) 5 new data sources per year: the lab provided 7 new data sources; 1) The AccLab in Iraq reached 710 youth from across the country, divided into students, unemployed and employed graduates, and youth who participated in the experimented local solutions mapped by the AccLab to simulate their brains using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based on real data collected through a survey. 2) The AccLab used the Words and Hashtags on social media as a source of data. The algorithms of social media platforms are designed to assist users in finding information. The AccLab observed the trending words (hashtags) and connected the dots to build understanding of what is going on in the community and find local solutions. 3) The AccLab reached the community through an online survey to investigate people&apos;s interest and willingness to participate in climate change initiatives. The aim is to gauge people&#x2019;s interest and 4) The AccLab in Iraq used Social Media questions feature to test local community knowledge about climate change challenges and the current climate actions to tackle the challenge.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">PS: The Lab started in September 2019 and the main challenge was the uncompleted Accelerator Lab Iraq Team, since the 100 days Plan was solo drafted by the Head of Solutions Mapping and the Accelerator Lab Focal Point, while missing the input and cooperation of the Head of the Exploration and Head of Experimentation members and the Head of Solution&#x2019;s Mapping had to perform all the tasks of Experimentation and Exploration with the guidance of the focal point. the team was completed in February, 2020.

Executive Summary of the Results:
100 Days Plan for the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Iraq aimed at sense-making, exploring, and testing with the local community in Iraq, while actively building partnerships with decision-makers to highlight the main issues within youth and unemployment and to pave the way towards identifying local Iraqi solutions. The UNDP Accelerator Lab - Iraq identified the following priorities: develop and localize innovative global methodologies to fit the Accelerator Lab work in Iraq, and find and experiment one local solution related to youth and unemployment; while focusing on building a collaborative voluntary team &#x201C;Accelerator Lab Community Service Team&#x201D;. 
To achieve the proposed objectives, the Accelerator Lab performed (5) workshops, (2) events to perform sense-making activities, and (6) meetings. The meetings, workshops and events were held with government officials, private sector representatives and NGOs in Erbil and Baghdad to build partnerships and establish the foundation for a supportive ecosystem. The audience of the activities included representatives of government institutions, university teachers, private sector, local and international NGOs, youth initiatives, co-working spaces, entrepreneurs, and UN agencies. The Accelerator Lab methodologies while directing the discussions and analysis of the current structural problems in youth and unemployment in Iraqi&#x2019;s ecosystem were Systemic Thinking, Design Thinking, Systemic-Design Thinking and Collective Intelligence methodologies.
The Lab conducted one successful experiment in 2019 to test one of the main local solutions found by the Accelerator Lab (The localized Design Thinking Training Manual) and to validate its hypothesis of the 100 days action plan.
The results of the tested methodologies within the audience resulted in rich analysis regarding youth and unemployment and led the Accelerator Lab to identify the main issue within youth and unemployment in Iraq which is &#x201C;Tunnel-Vision of Employment&#x201D;.  The Accelerator Lab conducted a workshop in Erbil with 35 activists from all over Iraq to collect intelligence and use it to identify the main obstacles within youth and unemployment in Iraq, and after three days of analysis, using the adopted methodologies, the audience prioritized the issue of &#x201C;Tunnel-Vision of Employment. The Accelerator Lab took this issue further and aimed at understanding all its angles through holding a workshop with government officials to discuss and analyze the issue of &#x201C;Tunnel-Vision of Employment&#x201D; amongst youth. The discussion and analysis resulted in building on two opportunities one with the Department of Human Development at the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research and the General Directorate for Industrial Development at the Ministry of Industry and Minerals.</narrative>
