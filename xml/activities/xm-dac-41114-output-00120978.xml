       <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#xAD;2.1 Redesign of youth apprenticeship scheme, development of a toolkit for initial testing and a roadmap for scaling up nationwide. 
2.2 Testing the toolkit by engaging 150 preselected young women and men who are temporarily jobless due to COVID-19 restrictive measures and reduced economic activities in select regions in public and private sector organizations. Scheme is to be supplemented by professional trainings introduced and implemented. Depending on the needs of particular cities or districts, apprenticeships will include seasonal works (floods), support to people most hit by the crisis (elderly, PWDs), support for social care services to address women&#x2019;s additional burdens of unpaid care work with children, the sick, and elderly.
2.3 Development of practical recommendations on redeployment of labor force in the face of the crisis in addition to measures already introduced by the Government in view of a systematic approach to active employment measures for vulnerable groups.
&#xAD;3.1 Review of civil service rules for home-based work, wage subsidies, sick leaves etc. in order to respond to the pandemic. Analise technical limitations, legal and organizational obstacles for full scale telecommuting and business continuity on national, oblast and local levels. Develop a package of proposals for rapid implementation. 
&#xAD;3.2 Building capacity of 1,000 civil servants for effective telecommuting and business continuity, including effective self-management, teamwork, maintaining social interactions with colleagues, maintaining high levels of motivation and performance. Separate trainings for managers on leading by example in crisis setting.
&#xAD;3.3 Training and deployment of 5 psychologists for providing psychological help and counselling to civil servants not coping well with the crisis pressures and rapid change in working arrangements. Physical and IT infrastructure of the Public Administration Academy will be utilized as platform for delivering psycho-social counselling and advice. 
&#xAD;3.4 Preparing recommendations for introductions into the public administration reform process.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">2.1-2.2. UNDP provided employment opportunities to 150 at-risk youth as part of its COVID-19 response program. Young people, who lost their jobs to the pandemic, took part in a subsidized three-month apprenticeship programme, accompanied by soft skills training and mentorship. The apprentices were placed in private companies, NGOs and government agencies in Nur-Sultan, Almaty and Karagandy region. They were encouraged to try out a new profession and gain experience, while receiving a &#x20B8;60,000 monthly allowance. The companies were monitoring the apprentices and hired the best performers. Of the total number of 150 programme participants, most were women, who also make up over 90 percent of the recipients of targeted social assistance in Kazakhstan.
Overall, the project involved 25 mentors who were specifically trained for working with vulnerable youth. They conducted regular group and individual meetings with the apprentices. The internship also encouraged young people to pursue entrepreneurship in the future. Thanks to the new skills and knowledge acquired during the internship, about 20 percent of interns found additional funding sources for the implementation of their ideas and initiatives
2.3. Recommendation were developed as part of the SEIA.
3.1. Barriers for effective teleworking analyzed and 12 business processes selected for accelerated automation. Developed the package of specific proposals and recommendations for digitizing business processes of HR management in the public sector.
3.2. Around 2,000 civil servants were surveyed within the scope of Rapid Real Needs Assessment of Civil Servants in Crisis setting and under teleworking modalities in order to reflect the real training needs of civil servants in the current crisis.
1,006 civil servants of the central and local executive bodies of Kazakhstan, including 391 civil servants with disabilities, were trained on effective teleworking, with a specific focus on digital and communication skills. The content of the training was specifically designed for Kazakhstani civil servants following the President&#x2019;s decision to switch to teleworking for 70 % of the civil servants.
3.3. UNDP CO hired a psychologist-consultant, who conducted individual psychological sessions not only to the staff of the Civil Service Agency, but their spouses and even their children. The sessions were conducted online at a convenient time for the staff by an appointment. Overall, within one month there were 3 group video conferences (sessions) and 27 individual sessions.
3.4. The Government with the UNDP CO support commenced work on the end-to-end digitalization of Kazakhstani civil service to make it &#x201C;digital by default&#x201D;. This implies digitizing 100 % of all the HR management related activities. As a first step, recruitment and testing are being digitized to minimize the need for the physical presence of the candidates.</narrative>
