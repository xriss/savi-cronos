  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the preliminary results of the needs assessment of CAR JR7, the livelihood needs as well as WASH needs are enormous in the sub-prefecture of Bangassou and Bakouma due to the poverty of the population and the security situation that the country has experienced since this long period. The education sector in Bossangoa and Bakouma is also neglected, as is the rest of the country, especially this year with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to measures such as the closure of classrooms. According to the prefect of Bossangoa, given the vulnerability of their population, he is asking for the support of humanitarian partners in order to help improve the living conditions of his people who have suffered so much. Despite the interventions of humanitarian actors in this area, the needs in terms of child protection and food security remain a major challenge according to the Bangassou prefecture. The qualitative analysis of the data from the CAR-JR7 needs assessment indicates that children regularly face abuse, neglect, exploitation and sexual violence. Livelihood needs were also identified. For example, according to the inter-agency mission report, about 8294 people are acutely food insecure. Market-dependent households are the most affected. At the Mbomou level, particularly in Bangassou and Bakouma, SOS CV CAR intends to implement Protection and FSL activities through prevention and response as well as aspects related to gender-based violence and capacity building of community structures.

Thus in Bangassou, SOS CV CAR intends to strengthen its presence with local partners and community structures in the protection and promotion of children&apos;s rights. During our intervention within the framework of the JR6, the activities were implemented in partnership with the local NGO Vision D&#xE9;veloppement (VD), which has a very solid community base and which constitutes an important element in the implementation of our intervention strategy in the Bangassou area. In the JR7 we seek to strengthen this partnership via a larger program by the VD and an increased capacity strengthening of SOS CV CAR to VD. Through this partnership and training on child rights and protection, the Joint Response project will help to build and strengthen local protection committees (RECOPE), composed of women and men, including children themselves. These protection committees will help to prevent and respond to child rights violations, and to rebuild a more protective environment for children. The RECOPEs sharing their experiences is stimulated in order to accelerate ownership of the SOS VE protection strategy. 

However in Bossangoa (Ouham prefecture) we will finalise the exit strategy that was started in the previous phase (JR6). Some limited scale of support will be given.</narrative>
