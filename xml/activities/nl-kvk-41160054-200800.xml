   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Solving shortages of essential health commodities and acute problems in the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic in three fragile countries.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Covid-19 epidemic is having a large impact on the most fragile countries in the world where health systems are weak and ill-prepared for prevention and mitigation activities. Supply chains of essential health commodities to health facilities have also been disrupted aggravating the impact on the sector. Low income countries lack the funds to implement their Covid-19 Readiness and Response plans. There is a lack of PPE (personal protection equipment) for health staff and for community health workers and in shortage of supplies and medicines is bound to have a negative impact on the provision and use of primary health care services and on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. In the countries where Cordaid has its largest health programmes (DRC, CAR and Burundi), we can expect poor public health outcomes and results. 
To mitigate these effects Cordaid management approved 1.192.621 for these three countries for procuring PPE, medicines and medical supplies with the technical support of I+solutions, a supply-chain specialist with whom Cordaid has worked successfully in a.o. DRC.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary objective was to provide an initial boost to country-owned initiatives to respond accurately and timely to possibly upcoming Covid-19 epidemic community-transmitted outbreaks in three fragile countries where Cordaid  has sizable health programs, i.e. Burundi, Central African Republic and Democratic Republic of Congo.
A secondary objective referred to creating goodwill for Cordaid with government and donors so that Cordaid would be considered as a trustworthy and action-oriented International NGO, willing and able to contribute to the in-country Covid-19 plans for preparedness and responses. The appreciation would also include Cordaid&#x2019;s ability to provide procurement services in partnership with I+ Solutions.
Another secondary objective was to explore partnership with i+solutions on procurement, rather than just strengthening the supply-chain in-country which was the experience of cooperation between the two organizations until then. This with a view to an eventual framework agreement between the two organizations.</narrative>
