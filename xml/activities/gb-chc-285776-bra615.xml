   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COVID-19 Emergency Response: health accompaniment to vulnerably housed people in S&#xE3;o Paulo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By the end of July 2020 Brazil had over 2.4 million confirmed Coronavirus cases and near 90,000 deaths, with 0.5 million in S&#xE3;o Paulo (SP) alone and 21,000 deaths. Cases continued to rise as the country reopens. Health services were reportedly near to collapse and 58% of recorded deaths occurring at home. The 2 million people living in favelas and poor peri-urban communities, have been disproportionately affected with research showing that residents of the poorest districts of S&#xE3;o Paulo are 10 times more likely to die of COVID than those in wealthier neighbourhoods. Lack of economic options, crowded conditions, poor ventilation and lack of basic sanitation have made it difficult to follow guidelines. Poorer access to and quality of health care, higher pre-existing risk factors, and lack of reliable information have contributed to poorer outcomes. Low paid workers have lost their jobs and many have no money to buy food. Government emergency benefits (about half a minimum salary) have been difficult to access for many of the poorest.
This project will provide life-saving support with health, nutrition, information and protection needs to 24,978 people living in 26 informal occupations of land and buildings through the following interventions: provision of health accompaniment to 3,300 families to reduce their vulnerability to COVID-19 and ensure appropriate signposting to health services and treatment; provision of accurate information about the virus; accompaniment to access social protection policies; strengthening of 43 local solidarity committees involved in distribution of donations of food and hygiene to 6,600 families; prevention, referrals and emergency support for survivors of gender-based violence; advocacy to prevent evictions and ensure vulnerable people are not left without shelter; information sharing with duty-bearers about the needs of vulnerable groups during the crisis.</narrative>
