Children from the targeted schools will be selected based on the needs and vulnerability criteria and based on the education modality in their schools (face-to-face or distance learning) if a school had many confirmed COVID-19 cases and turned the physical education modality to the distancing modality. The project will provide internet vouchers to the most vulnerable children to allow them to continue receiving their online classes. In order to ensure that the children are committed to attend their lessons online, dedicated education supervisors will be assigned to follow up and measure the education outcomes along with the teachers and schools&#x2019; administrations. For the caregiver the education supervisor will conduct a caregiver engagement program in order to support children education at home level through enabling the caregiver to follow up, encourage, and support their children and ensure that the caregivers understand the importance of education for their children.
