   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
The support to JHRO has two components: a Civic Space Project and a Senior Women&apos;s Protection Adviser.  These projects will fund up to 70% of the JHRO country operations and will, thus, in principal constitute core support to the office. 

The aim of the component the Civic Space Project is to contribute to protect and widen the democratic space and create the necessary conditions for DRC to consolidate the democracy through the full respect and effective exercise of all human rights as a base for stability and peace in the country. Widening the democratic space will enable fair and transparent elections at different levels which will increase the active participation of the people. The project will protect and promote human rights through increasing both the capacity and the ownership of national institutions and civil society organisations to monitor and report on the human rights situation. The project also aims to increase the accountability for perpetrators of HRV, fight impunity and protect witnesses, victims and activists so that they can effectively perform their role. 

Apart from actively working to monitor and report human rights, the JHRO will also educate and train national institutions, civil society organisations, activists and journalists. JHRO will support national institutions such as the National Human Rights Commission, the Parliamentary Human Rights Commission and the department for human rights in their work through targeted education and logistical support. Activists, victims and witnesses will be protected through activities such as identification of early warning, creation of networks and providing psychosocial support. Impunity will be fought through logistical and technical support to judicial authorities as well as legal assistance to victims and witnesses, in principal to women.

The project will be implemented country wide with a mobile team covering the areas where JHRO or OHCHR are not present. Starting in locations where the JHRO is no longer present, the responsibility to protect and promote human rights and people&apos;s participation in democratic elections will gradually be handed over to local CSOs. 

The SWPA component lies under the mandate of the UNSRSG on sexual violence in conflict and the aim of this component is to strengthen the UN&apos;s possibility to consolidate the fight against conflict-related sexual violence in DRC. The project will focus on supporting the Senior Women Protection Adviser &#x2018;s deployment to reinforce the monitoring and analysis of conflict related sexual violence, further engage with parties to the conflict to more effectively prevent CRSV and advocate for the protection of women, girls, boys and men. The SWPA is based in Kinshasa and is coordinating four field-based Women Protection Advisors. The SWPA coordinates the work of the field-based advisors and the MONUSCO MARA (Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Arrangements) in their respective role to monitor, analyse and report the situation of conflict related sexual violence and to identify and support victims and witnesses. the SWPA shall perform advocacy for the full implementation of the national action plans of the police and military to decrease sexual violence internally, shall support the engagement of non-state actors, and shall ensure that CRSV considerations will continue to be mainstreamed throughout the responsibilities of relevant mission components (military, police and civilian) at strategic and operational level.</narrative>

St&#xF6;det till JHRO har tv&#xE5; komponenter: &quot;Civic Space Project&quot; och &quot;Senior Women Protection Adviser&quot;. Genom projekten finansieras upp till 70% av MR-kontorets verksamhet i DRK och Sidas st&#xF6;d utg&#xF6;r d&#xE4;rf&#xF6;r i princip ett k&#xE4;rnst&#xF6;d till landverksamheten. 

Komponenten the Civic Space Project syftar till att skydda och ut&#xF6;ka det demokratiska utrymmet och skapa n&#xF6;dv&#xE4;ndiga f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttningar f&#xF6;r DRK att f&#xF6;rst&#xE4;rka sin demokrati genom full respekt f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter som bas f&#xF6;r fred och stabilitet i landet. Att ut&#xF6;ka det demokratiska utrymmet m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r f&#xF6;r r&#xE4;ttvisa och transparanta val p&#xE5; olika niv&#xE5;er vilket ut&#xF6;kar befolkningens aktiva deltagande. Projektet ska skydda och fr&#xE4;mja m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter genom att &#xF6;ka b&#xE5;de kapaciteten och &#xE4;gandeskapet f&#xF6;r nationella institutioner och civilsamh&#xE4;llsorganisationer att &#xF6;vervaka och rapportera efterlevnaden av m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter. Projektet syftar &#xE4;ven till att &#xF6;ka ansvarsutkr&#xE4;vande f&#xF6;r brott, bek&#xE4;mpa straffriheten och skydda vittnen, offer och aktivister s&#xE5; att de effektivt kan ut&#xF6;va sin roll.

F&#xF6;rutom att aktivt arbeta f&#xF6;r att &#xF6;vervaka och rapportera om efterlevnaden av m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter kommer JHRO utbilda och tr&#xE4;na nationella institutioner, civilsamh&#xE4;llsorganisationer, aktivister och journalister. JHRO kommer att st&#xF6;tta nationella institutioner som National Human Rights Commission, parlamentets MR-kommission och departementet f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter i deras arbete genom riktad utbildning samt logistiskt st&#xF6;d. Aktivister, offer och vittnen kommer att skyddas genom aktiviteter s&#xE5;som identifiering av &quot;early-warning,&quot; skapande av n&#xE4;tverk och tillhandah&#xE5;llande av psykosocialt st&#xF6;d. Genom logistik- och tekniskt st&#xF6;d till juridiska institutioner samt assistans och juridisk hj&#xE4;lp till offer och vittnen, fr&#xE4;mst kvinnor, kommer straffrihet bek&#xE4;mpas.

Projektet implementeras &#xF6;ver hela landet med ett mobilt team som t&#xE4;cker de omr&#xE5;den d&#xE4;r JHRO eller OHCHR inte har egen n&#xE4;rvaro. Fr&#xE4;mst och till att b&#xF6;rja med p&#xE5; orter d&#xE4;r JHRO inte l&#xE4;ngre har egen n&#xE4;rvaro ska lokala akt&#xF6;rer gradvis ta &#xF6;ver ansvaret f&#xF6;r att skydda och fr&#xE4;mja efterlevnaden av de m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheterna och folkets deltagande i demokratiska val.

Komponenten SWPA Project ligger under mandatet f&#xF6;r FN:s generalsekreterares s&#xE4;rskilde s&#xE4;ndebud f&#xF6;r sexuellt v&#xE5;ld i konflikt och syftar till att st&#xE4;rka FNs m&#xF6;jlighet att f&#xF6;rdjupa kampen mot konfliktrelaterat sexuellt v&#xE5;ld i DRK.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In spite of the Covid-19-pandemic and the restrictions as well as the state of emergency due to the pandemic, the JHRO managed to perform many of its planned activities during the reporting period.&#xA0; The following are examples of activities and results of the Civic Space component of the contribution: First and foremost, the office carried out its regular monitoring, investigation, and reporting activities on the human rights situation, including on human rights and fundamental freedoms linked to restrictions to democratic space, and specific groups, such as women, youth, HRDs and journalists. The monitoring, investigation and reporting activities were strengthened to take into consideration specific risks of HRVs related to the state of emergency and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the human rights implication of the Covid-19 pandemic, they also prepared and shared&#xA0;monitoring tools on the human rights situation in the fight against Covid-19 in order to address the human rights implications of the pandemic. The office published&#xA0;12 monthly reports, one annual and one bi-annual reports, as well as five public reports on the human rights situation in the DRC Two workshops on the monitoring and reporting of hate speech, an important element of violations against the civic space, were organised with UNJHRO field officers to improve their capacities on monitoring and reporting such human rights violations. At least 124 capacity-building and awareness-raising activities were organised with various audiences, including civil society organizations (CSO), State and non-State actors on human rights. In total, 9,329 participants including 2,994 women (32%) took part in these activities, with the objective to sensitise and reinforce capacities of CSO, State institutions and agents, as well as the larger DRC population. The activities included at least 22 sessions supported by the project aimed at enhancing civic participation and widening the democratic space, including by building capacities of journalists on their role and responsibility in the consolidation of democracy. These capacity-building activities focused on improving knowledge, understanding and ownership of and advocacy for civil and political rights, fundamental rights and individual freedoms, as well economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to health. The office supported partners, including national institutions, in setting up a toll-free number (122) to respond to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in the context of the pandemic confinement. Reports have shown that more than 8,000 calls were received monthly from August to Dec. 2020.&#xA0; The fight against impunity was reinforced through technical and logistical support to military and civilian judicial authorities for the investigation and prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other grave human rights violations.&#xA0; The office provided technical and material support to and reinforced capacities of the National Human Rights Institutions (NHRI). A total of 13 training sessions were held in Kinshasa for 437 participants, of which 125 were women, for the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), the Ministry of Human Rights (MoHR), the Human Rights Commission of the National Assembly (HRCNA) and the Ministry Delegate for Persons with Disabilities and other Vulnerable People (MPDVP). The trainings and coaching strengthened NHRC&#x2019;s capacities and helped them to produce various reports, such as their Annual report on the human rights situation, monitoring and investigation on human rights violations covering 2019. Moreover, UNJHRO assistance reinforced the ability of the NHRC, MPDVP and HRCNA to carry out advocacy activities in Parliament, such as to foster support for the adoption of laws. The National Assembly adopted draft laws on persons with disabilities and the one on the protection of the rights of indigenous people in November 2020. And for the Senior Women Protection Advisor (SWPA) component, the following are examples of results: The WPA Unit continued monitoring and reporting on conflict related sexual violence (CRSV) through the UNJHRO&#x2019;s field offices, sub-offices and OHCHR presences. This crucial work continued despite the challenges presented by COVID-19 restrictions. In September 2020, the WPA Unit developed a new advocacy and outreach strategy for 2021 to address the complex CRSV and protection dynamics in conflict-affected provinces. The strategy examines the root structural causes of armed conflict and related human rights, women&#x2019;s protection and CRSV challenges and proposes ways to address these through innovative education and outreach activities. Technical support was provided to other UNJHRO thematic units to ensure integration of CRSV prevention and response perspectives in their work, sharing guidance and relevant guidelines on CRSV, providing accurate and updated information on situations, in particular the Transitional Justice and Fight against Impunity and Protection units. The WPA Unit carried out outreach and awareness-raising activities using newly developed training materials for the MONUSCO Force, UNPOL (the UN civilian police), FARDC (the national army) and PNC (the national police). The WPA Unit continued to share early waring alerts and information on CRSV risks, collected from human rights monitoring. Engagement with the Government of the DRC continued over this reporting period, including regular telephone and virtual meetings with the Office of the Special Advisor to the President on Youth, Gender and Violence against Women to share information on CRSV-related matters and advocate for progress in the implementation of national strategies to prevent and stop sexual violence. The engagement served to move ahead the development of the roadmap for the implementation of the 2019 Addendum to the 2013 Joint Communiqu&#xE9;. Progress was also made in the implementation of the national FARDC and PNC action plans to prevent sexual violence of which key aspects are capacity building and awareness-raising.&#xA0; WPAs and CRSV focal points in field offices continued to have regular engagement with provincial authorities, the FARDC, PNC and civil society on CRSV, following up on allegations of CRSV by State agents and including officials in discussions on strategies to prevent and respond to CRSV. The information collected through monitoring and investigations into CRSV was shared on a regular basis with judicial authorities, with advocacy to conduct judicial investigations and prosecute perpetrators resulting in fact finding missions and investigations.</narrative>
