   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Demonstration of a successful private sector technical vocational education and training model that contributes to improved employability of its students. Expansion of vocational education that is focused on manual skills into fragile and conflict affected states (FCS) where these skills are in shortage via South-South investments by the Group. Women&apos; employment: expansion of vocational education is expected to help addressing women&apos;s unemployment issue, as women&apos; participation in labor market in Jordan is one of the lowest in the world. Evidence suggests that women at the higher end of educational spectrum and with employable skills may have better probability of being employed. Job creation: The growth in offerings Luminus is looking to embark on can only be achieved by hiring the right personnel in terms of caliber, qualifications, and numbers. The number of those employed by the Company is projected to double in 5 years, reaching around 1200 employees in 2024 as compared to
compared to a total of 506 employees in 2019, 34% out of which are expected to be women, employed at wage rates higher than market average to ensure attracting the level of competence required.</narrative>
