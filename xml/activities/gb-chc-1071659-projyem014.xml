   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An integrated FSL and CP Project will be implemented in Bani Husaish, Sanaa Governorate to assist children and families affected by COVID-19, including IDPs who are among the most vulnerable groups in the context of the pandemic. WCUK will assist 488 new IDPs Households (HHs) through provision of unconditional cash assistance covering the Minimum Food Basket (MFB) and will further provide cash for protection assistance to 112 identified vulnerable cases. Finally, WCUK will provide legal documentation support to IDPs communities. Due to the conflict in Yemen and the crisis most of the IDPs do not have legal documents, as they either lost them or left them behind in their houses. Children need birth certificates to be able to join schools and get further help from other organizations. Parents need IDs as well to be able to receive any type of help such as cash and food baskets, etc. WC UK will assist IDPs without documentation and referring them to appropriate authorities. These documents will include issuing birth certificates for children and IDs for adults (+18).</narrative>
