   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RBDS will support local Sierra Leonean companies that are considered &#x201C;missing middle SMEs.&#x201D; These firms are locally owned and managed, have a workforce ranging from five to fifty, and annual revenues between $25,000 to $1.5M. They are viable enterprises but are struggling because of the economic impacts of EVD. They typically have strong entrepreneurial skills but inefficient internal business systems and structures. Firms in the missing middle are generally ignored by NGOs and other organizations that provide enterprise support. But, these businesses are very important for local supply chains and local livelihoods.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The economic challenges created by EVD are daunting and have magnified the suffering in each of the three affected countries. World Bank figures suggest that the Sierra Leonean economy is the worst hit; its economic growth plunged from 16.7% in 2012 to an estimated 4% in 2014 and the Bank is forecasting that it will contract by 2% in 2015. In all three countries the fear of contagion has curbed economic activity and created other negative implications impacting investor confidence, trade, mobility, agriculture and all of this has affected government revenues and financial sector liquidity. 

The ReGrow methodology was conceived with the direction and input of international and local companies within EPSMG and is now being refined and structured in programmatic form by two NGOs, RESOLVE and Cordaid, and two Sierra Leonean private sector firms, DALAN Advisory &amp; Development Consultants and the Mano River Marketing Company. ReGrow&#x2019;s methodology is innovative, easily replicable, and offers a simple means of engaging private sector projects in the EVD affected countries with global sources of capital. Dalberg Global Development Advisors (&#x201C;Dalberg&#x201D;) and the Sierra Leone Investment and Export Promotion Agency (&#x201C;SLIEPA&#x201D;) will also participate in ReGrow as implementing partners, as will several other local Sierra Leonean businesses. ReGrow&#x2019;s methodology includes two core components, SME Support and the ReGrow MarketPlace.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of ReGrow&#x2019;s SME Support is to save good SMEs from bankruptcy and assist them in getting back on their feet. 

The investment stage of SME Support is expected to include cash infusions that will average about $50,000 and will be for terms of 24-36 months and interest rates near market levels.</narrative>
