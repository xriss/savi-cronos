   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving access to improved water source and safe drinking water in Veal Veng district, Pursat</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is complemented to one of CAFOD partner (COCD) target communities in Veal Veng district, Pursat province. The overall goal of the project is to develop more capacity and resources of most marginalised families to engage in community dialogues in order to promote development in their communities. Through COCD project implementation, it has revealed that target community people are facing immediate needs on accessing safe water for their daily consumption and the limitation knowledge of local authorities and community people on safe drinking water; while, COCD&#x2019;s project has focused on livelihood development specifically. In late September to October 2020, these communities were faced flash flooding that caused water system from waterfall, which is a main water source for people in Tumpor community, was damaged and it caused people lack of safe drinking water and poor hygiene practices. 
COCD and RWC have discussed with key informants in communities on current situations, challenges and discuss for solutions for improvement of community health through drinking safe water and proper hygiene practices in which an entry point would be focused on improving water supply system in community and building community committee and people on safe drinking water management. On the other hand, to deeply understand community challenges and to response to people needs, partner has conducted a feasibility study by involving from all community groups of people to ensure that the project has responded to community needs and reached to marginalized groups. 
Two specific objectives are proposed:
- To improve the access to clean water of poorest households through promoting active participation in water management process in order to meet their needs for better livelihoods. 
- To improve the capacity of water management committees on water management and to enable them to be able to support the poorest community people addressing their needs on water.
Some approaches have been proposed based on community resources including: 1).  upgrading households water facilities and households water treatment and safety storage, 2). upgrading local public water assets including waterfall and pond, 3) capacity improvement for water management committee, and 4) community people awareness to improve situation of accessing to drinking safe water and proper hygiene practice including the precaution of Covid-19 pandemic. 
To contribute to CAFOD strategy&#x2013; OCH, project will demonstrate its clean technology in upgrading water assets and promotion of collection rainwater throughout community to ensure the safety, access, dignity and inclusion by targeting for poor and disadvantage peoples in the community to be supported through project. Also, the implemented project is a CAFOD&#x2019;s new working approach of linking resources among our partners to support and contribute each other in order to respond immediately needs of community people.</narrative>
