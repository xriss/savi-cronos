   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Access to Information: Information is a crucial component of containment efforts and a number of basic prevention strategies exist that are highly effective to prevent the spread of the infection. 

Access to Sanitation Materials: Communities will be provided with specially modified buckets with a pipe in order to have access to safe running water for hand washing. Chlorine will be provided with the buckets to promote hand washing, one of the best basic prevention methods. Demonstration on proper mixture of chlorine-water as well as proper hand washing will be conducted. 

Access to Clean and Safe Drinking Water: Communities will be supported with the rehabilitation of existing wells. The continued if not increased access to clean and safe drinking water is key, as it prevents people from contracting water-borne illnesses in a situation where clinics and hospitals are largely inaccessible.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to contribute to containment of Ebola virus and effectively arrest its transmission through behavior change. This is done through awareness raising and community dialogue where Ebola virus is discussed and information is provided on symptoms, prevention, hygiene and home care as well as on how to deal with the ill, what happens if a person is taken into an ETU, what happens if a person dies and what is the purpose of disinfection of houses, etc. In addition, challenges and constraints of communities in dealing with Ebola are noted in order to improve the response and address the felt needs where possible and to report the community challenges to relevant actors.

The goal of the project is behavior change leading to breaking the chain of transmission of Ebola virus.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">The data presented represent total progress of ZOA Liberia&#x2019;s Ebola Response up to May 31- 2015.

To date, ZOA Liberia reached 637,520 people with awareness raising on Ebola. Community dialogues have been held in 813 communities in Montserrado, Margibi, Bong and Bomi and Grand Bassa counties. 36,025 special faucet buckets and bleach bottles and 111.393 pieces of soap have been distributed.

The contribution to the above figures of this Embassy project is that ZOA Liberia under this project purchased 3000 buckets-with-faucets and stickers, and 3000 gallons/bottles of chlorine, distributing these on a one-to-one household basis to 3000, which equals at an average household size of 5.1 members per household, 15300 beneficiaries reached with buckets and chlorine. Additionally, ZOA Liberia purchased 61920 pieces of soap under this project, which it distributed it on a one person one piece basis, so 61920 people supplied with soap.

In the operational areas the hygiene practices and the infection prevention practices have improved. People are aware of Ebola, modes of transmission and what to do and not to do in case of suspected illness. They are open and accepting of the ETUs and the burial teams. Many people report that ZOA&#x2019;s intervention has been most valuable and has prevented additional deaths.

The project component well construction in EVD affected communities has largely been completed during the second half of the project, through subcontracting a number of contractors at the same time, to jointly reach the rehabilitation of 20 wells under this project in total.

Currently the main challenges are the consequences of Ebola, such as psychological trauma and loss of livelihoods, which ZOA Liberia with support from various donors is trying to address through a set of related activities including agricultural support, socio-therapy trust building support, livelihoods support, and ongoing WASH interventions.</narrative>
