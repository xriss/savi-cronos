   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Measures taken to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in an increase in food insecurity in Honduras, particularly in marginal urban areas of Tegucigalpa, where many people are currently unable to earn an income. The crisis is exacerbating many of the drivers of migration in these high-sending communities. At the IAF, we support community-led approaches to expand economic opportunities. Our grantee partner, Grupo Juvenil Dion (GJD), is organizing a volunteer effort to establish emergency community kitchens and workshops to create 15,000 masks in five marginal areas of Tegucigalpa, recruiting gastronomy graduates of their training program and community volunteers for a short-term response to food-insecure families. GJD will also provide technical assistance and access to affordable credit to assist young entrepreneurs and their small businesses in recovering from the current economic crisis. This grant is part of the IAF&apos;s efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration in Central America and is part of the IAF&apos;s broader COVID-19 response strategy..

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Alarming levels of crime and violence, high levels of poverty and food insecurity, and ineffective governance and corruption all threaten Honduras&apos; fragile democracy. U.S. foreign assistance plays a critical role in supporting Honduras&apos; development as a safe, democratic, and prosperous nation that offers hope to Hondurans so they see their future in Honduras and not elsewhere. U.S. assistance supports civil society engagement in shaping public policy, a necessary component of a healthy democracy. The President&apos;s Feed the Future (FTF) program also figures prominently in the programs to reduce extreme poverty and increase economic opportunity in the poorest rural areas of the country. These activities will be provided through technical assistance, grants, and loans. By supporting targeted activities in these areas of intervention, USAID will also help address the underlying factors contributing to migration to the United States. In October 2014, the U.S. government launched the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (Strategy), which complements the work undertaken by national governments and multilateral development banks, to support the priority objectives identified in the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle. The Strategy focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
