   <narrative xml:lang="EN">St Alberts Mission Hospital COVID-19 Emergency Response 2020</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">St Alberts Mission Hospital values the right to life and the Dignity of the person in its response to COVID 19, a global epidemic that is life threatening.
The Hospital being a member of the ZCBC Health institutions and run by medical Missionaries who also belong to the family of CARITAS INTERNATIONALIS, and  believe in totality to the dignity of the person and in reaching out to the most vulnerable has made an appeal for support in terms of PPE equipment to help the resource constrained Mission Hospital respond to COVID-19 effectively.
The Hospital has a comparative advantage, for it strides across three provinces, namely Mashonaland West, Mashonaland Central and accessible by people from other provinces mainly Mashonaland East making it a prime port of call for the emergency response. It has a record for being people centred during the HIV and AIDS challenges in the country. The hospital prides itself for being able to work effectively with the communities as it had a pool of volunteers dedicated  and trained to l be able to cascade accurate information in the communities on prevention, and case management.
PREVENTION is their catch word where there is no cure and prevention is the way to go, social distancing, self-isolating and regular thorough washing of hands with soapy water or use of at least above 70% alcohol based hand sanitisers . 
Procurement of the PPE materials will go a long way in alleviating pain and suffering to Zimbabwean communities and at the same time giving confidence and assurance to the health care and ancillary staff who will be working on the frontline  to dedicate themselves to serving the most vulnerable cases in the communities and presented at the hospital.</narrative>
