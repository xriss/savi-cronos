  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Immediate socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 are most severely affecting the poorest and most marginalized, and in particular those previously relying on informal or day labour (approximately 60% of employment in Sri Lanka is informal), or with insecure rights. These households have been immediately rendered destitute and unable to buy food.  Government support measures are being organised, but civil society response is needed for rapid response and to help ensure that all vulnerable groups are included, and the government is actively requesting NGOs for help.  This grant will support provision of an emergency food and NFI package to 1,100 families at a cost of SLR 3,000 per pack. 

Targeted families will be those most vulnerable as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown measures or because a family member is under treatment for COVID-19. The pack will contain items for public health protection, including soap, face masks, and information leaflet in local language. Items will be sufficient for the needs of one family (4-5 members) for one week. 

This intervention forms one component of CSL&#x2019;s wider national response to provide basic food and preventive health supplies for families which are vulnerable because they lack the means to purchase them; cash assistance for purchase of medicines; and PPE for social/ health/ care workers. There are particular concerns that children, pregnant mothers and older people will go hungry, and CSL plans to target its intervention to ensure they are prioritised.</narrative>
