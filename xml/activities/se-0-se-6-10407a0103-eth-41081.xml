   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att bek&#xE4;mpa covid-19
Omprogrammerade medel f&#xF6;r att lindra konsekvenserna av covid-19
Organisationen Farm Afrika har ans&#xF6;kt om medel hos Sida p&#xE5; 56 500 000 SEK f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra projektet &quot;Integrated approach to improving rural livelihoods, empowering communities and partner&quot; i Etiopien. 

Projektet syftar till att &#xE5;stadkomma en f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad, effektiv och h&#xE5;llbar metod f&#xF6;r klimatsmart, produktivt och l&#xF6;nsamt jordbruk genom att st&#xE4;rka kapaciteten hos m&#xE4;n och kvinnor, p&#xE5; lokal och regional niv&#xE5; samt andra viktiga akt&#xF6;rer inom den privata sektorn. Projektet &#xE4;r speciellt utformat f&#xF6;r att st&#xE4;rka projektledningskapaciteten hos genomf&#xF6;randepartners och att fr&#xE4;mja synergieffekter n&#xE4;r det &#xE4;r m&#xF6;jligt. Det &#xE5;stadkoms genom f&#xF6;ljande tre sammanh&#xE4;ngande komponenter: 1) Kapacitetsutveckling  av projektansvariga och partners (UEWCA och dess associerade medlemmar) i utformning och f&#xF6;rvaltning av det &#xF6;vergripande projektet, inklusive de olika tekniska, ekonomiska, sociala och milj&#xF6;m&#xE4;ssiga aspekterna av projektets utformning, projektledning, uppf&#xF6;ljning och utv&#xE4;rdering, kommunikation och samordning.
2. Strategiskt st&#xF6;d till viktiga lokala partners (s&#xE5;som inv&#xE5;narna i respektive region, jordbruksf&#xF6;retag, CBOs och CSOs, lokala och regionala statliga institutioner, mm.) som genomf&#xF6;r aktiviteter f&#xF6;r att st&#xF6;dja kvinnor i f&#xF6;retag, inklusive organisatoriskt kapacitetst&#xF6;d inom viktiga teknikomr&#xE5;den, s&#xE4;rskilt klimatsmart jordbruk, v&#xE4;rdekedjeutveckling samt mobilisering av lokala samh&#xE4;llsgrupper.
3. &#xD6;ka ekonomi och klimatresiliens hos sm&#xE5;brukare genom klimatsmart marknadsstyrd produktion av h&#xF6;gv&#xE4;rdiga gr&#xF6;dor.

Delprojekt 1 och 3 kommer att implementeras av Farm Africa. Delprojekt 2 kommer att implementeras av Union for Ethiopian Women Chariatable Association (UEWCA). Farm Afrika kommer att underteckna avtalet med Sida och d&#xE4;refter betala ut till UEWCA enligt utbetalningsplan. UEWCA betalar ut 70% av medlen till sina associerade medlemmar f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;rande av projektet p&#xE5; gr&#xE4;srotsniv&#xE5;.

Med fokus p&#xE5; SNNP (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples&apos; Region) Regional State i Delprojekt 3 (specifika woredas/distrikt &#xE5;terst&#xE5;r att ta beslut om), sju regionala stater och Addis Ababa City Administration iDelprojekt2, samt i omr&#xE5;den d&#xE4;r de CSOs verkar som tar del av kapacitetsuppbyggnadsst&#xF6;d i Delprojekt1.

Projektet l&#xF6;per &#xF6;ver fyra &#xE5;r och totala budgeten uppg&#xE5;r till 56 500 000 SEK. Sida &#xE4;r ensam finansi&#xE4;r. Projektets struktur och inneh&#xE5;ll har diskuterats och utvecklats i samr&#xE5;d med Ambassaden i Addis. Farm Afrika ansvarar f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra kvalitetss&#xE4;kring, tekniska system, givarrapportering och korrekt anv&#xE4;ndning av medel, medan UEWCA och dess associerade medlemmar p&#xE5; regional niv&#xE5; ansvarar f&#xF6;r genomf&#xF6;randet av aktiviteter p&#xE5; f&#xE4;ltniv&#xE5;, l&#xE4;gesrapporter och engagerande av statliga partners. Farm Afrika undertecknar avtalet med Sida och genomf&#xF6;randepartner UEWCA; och kommer att vara ansvarig f&#xF6;r utbetalning av medel till UEWCA och genom UEWCA till dess associerade medlemmar p&#xE5; regional niv&#xE5;. Farm Afrika kommer att ansvara f&#xF6;r att rapportera projektets m&#xE5;luppfyllelse och resultat enligt den med Sida &#xF6;verenskomna arbetsplanen. Farm Africa &#xE4;r ensam ansvarig f&#xF6;r alla &#xE5;taganden i avtalet gentemot Sida och kommer att underteckna avtalet med Sida. Innan utbetalning g&#xF6;rs med tredje part kommer Farm Afrika  ocks&#xE5; att underteckna ett avtal med UEWCA f&#xF6;r utbetalning till dem.

Projektet finansierar personal vid Farm Africas kontor i London/regionala kontoret samt Ethiopia Country Offices och personal p&#xE5; UEWCA. D&#xE4;rut&#xF6;ver finansieras trainings, workshops, pilottester, kommunikationsmaterial, mm. I delprojekt 1 g&#xE5;r st&#xF6;rsta delen av budgeten till kapacitetsuppbyggnad och M&amp;E-f&#xF6;rst&#xE4;rkning av Farm Afrika och UEWCA. I delprojekt 2 &#xE4;r huvudbudgetposten st&#xF6;d till UEWCAs projektgenomf&#xF6;rande medan delprojekt 3 g&#xE5;r till att genomf&#xF6;ra CSA (Climate Smart Agriculture)-relaterad verksamhet. Samtliga tre delprojekt har budget f&#xF6;r uppf&#xF6;ljning och utv&#xE4;rdering.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The program aims to provide an improved, effective, and sustainable approach to climate smart agricultural, productivity and profitability, through strengthened capacities of men and women, Youth at a community level, local government level and other key stakeholders within the private sector. The project is specifically designed to strengthen the project management capacities of the implementing partners and to promote synergies, where possible.The goal of the new intervention i.e. &quot;Growth for the Future (G4F): Programme II. Natural Resource Management for Resilience and Economic Development in Rural Ethiopia&quot; is to contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation in Oromia, SNNPR, Amhara (Wollo district) and Gambella regional states and demonstrate best practices of integrated NRM and rural development through creating access to finance and market as well as improved appropriate technologies as a way to success. Consortium partners will achieve this through: 1) direct implementation of enterprise and natural resource management interventions at two programme sites of the Ethiopian Central Rift Valley, in Wollo district and Majang Forest Biosphere Reserve and 2) development of policy and learning platforms at the programme level to share learning and policy advocacy regionally. Testing and developing innovative and improved NRM approaches that can be taken to scale will support the GoE to attain its ambitious green and resilient growth strategy. Close linkage with other programs supported by the government will be sought.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Major achievements&#xA0;for each programs include;&#xA0; Sub-programme 1: Harnessing Smallholder Productivity, Adapting to Climate Change and Protecting the EnvironmentProject One (Capacity building of state and non-state actors project, implemented by Farm Africa):  &#x2022; A total of 48 (10 women) staff members drawn from 15 NGOs were trained and well-capacitated in the areas of leadership and team management and data management. &#x2022; Organizational capacity score (OCS) of Farm Africa (in finance/corporate, program/M&amp;amp;E and leadership) reached 78% compared to baseline (67.2%). This is believed to contribute to Farm Africa&#x2019;s ability to provide better quality technical, managerial and financial management support to CSOs and other partners. The OCS is reduced by 10% from last year due to staff turnover specifically in the finance section.&#x2022; Organizational capacity score of CSOs reached 89% which shows 33.7% increment from the baseline figure (55.3%). Accordingly, organizational capacity to manage multi-sectoral and integrated projects is believed to have increased. &#x2022; Average KAP score of targeted CSOs, CBOs and government staff trained and capacitated in the area of CSA and NRM reached 79.4% which shows 21.2% increment from the baseline figure (58.2%). These improvements is believed to have enabled partners to deliver on results with good technical quality. As a result,&#xA0;UEWCA&#xA0;has been capable enough to revise their strategic plan by including agriculture, CC and NRM. Project Two, Women economic empowerment project implemented by UEWCA and 12 CSOs) &#x2022; Awareness education has been given to 131,625 community members in the areas of climate change, adaptation and mitigation practices through previously established women discussion groups, school mini-medias, radio, posters and billboards.&#x2022; Average HH knowledge score on climate change manifestations has reached 65% compared to 39% baseline. Proportions of households practicing CSA have increased from 29% during baseline to 75%. Associated with this, six CSA practices per HH have been adopted on average. This implies improvements in community knowledge and attitude on climate change cause, effect and adaptation and mitigation practices.&#x2022; 731 farmers (527 female) were provided with 169 Qt of improved crop seeds and engaged in CSA and 2,380 HHs have accessed irrigation water and develop 176 hectares of land through construction of two irrigation canals, one-night storages, 21 water pumps and one rain water harvesting structures.&#x2022; 3,697 women-headed households have been supported with IGA with the purpose of diversifying their income and ensure resilient economy.&#x2022; 1,722 members (female = 1,505, male= 217) which were organized in 79 VSLAs have saved ETB 1,114,361, from which ETB 772,240 birr have been revolved as a loan and create a job for 2,747 women.&#x2022; 36 animal health clinics were supported with medical supplies and medicines with the purpose of&#xA0;capacitating the vet clinics to provide animal health services for the communities.&#x2022; Rehabilitation and development activities have been done in 2,642 hectares of degraded lands in 22 watersheds and area closure sites. As part of the Green Legacy initiative, 98,131 tree seedlings were planted in different watersheds.&#x2022; The&#xA0;engagement of community members in adoption of CSA practices have resulted in doubling the crop yield compared to the traditional farming in Adama&#xA0;Zuria&#xA0;Woreda. Women engaged in irrigation farming, IGA and VSLA have started to build their resilience to climate and other shocks such as Covid-19.  Project Three (CSA project implemented by Farm Africa): &#x2022; Training of Trainers (ToT) on CSA and seed multiplication to 63 front line&#xA0;experts (DAs, agricultural experts and project staff) have been delivered. The front line&#xA0;staff have also providing training to 824 (422 females) smallholder farmers on CSA and 496 (254 females) seed multiplier &amp;amp; follower farmers on seed multiplication.&#x2022; Agricultural inputs have been facilitated to CSA and seed multiplier farmers through linking farmers to cooperatives and unions.&#x2022; The adoption rate of CSA practices by farmers increased from the baseline of 5 CSA practices/farmer to 10 CSA practices/farmer. This has contributed for positive changes in crop yield for all high value crops compared to the baseline.&#x2022; The seed multipliers have been organized in cluster basis and 88 hectares of land have been covered to multiply seeds of pepper, haricot bean and chick pea. Accordingly, 432 quintals&#xA0;(sacks) of hot pepper, 660 quintals (sacks) of haricot bean and 368 quintals (sacks) of chick pea have been produced and now ready to supply to their respective cooperatives. This is expected to ensure sustainable seed supply to smallholder farmers.&#x2022; 13 farmers&#x2019; cooperative committee members have been trained in business development model and three coops were supported with seed money to engage in agricultural product marketing. Accordingly, farmers cooperatives have been engaging in buying and selling of agricultural products from smallholder farmers. Currently cooperatives bought high value crops from farmers with an average of 15% price increment from the local price and were able to aggregate and store the products for extended months in expectation of better selling prices, with the multiplier effect of improving&#xA0;food security&#xA0;at HH level.&#x2022; Membership size of cooperatives has been doubled (from average 108 members to 285 at this time) and cooperatives&#x2019; capital increased by 5 folds (from average of 250,000 birr to 1,500,000 Birr). As a result, 58% of target HHs have got access to better markets (selling to coops and buyers)1.&#x2022; The project has been facilitated the establishment of VSLA&#x2019;s in the target 15 kebeles. The total number of VSLAs established reached to 352 with 7,584 members (male = 2,868, female = 4,716). The total amount of saving mobilized in the reporting period reached to ETB 2,750,203, from which ETB 2,201,750 have been revolved for loan to 5,987 (Male=1814 and Female=4173) members to run small businesses. The members have received business skill training and able to run local small businesses and getting profit. The profit from small businesses enabled households (HHs) to cover school materials, clothing, and shoes for their children and improve their livelihoods. To ensure sustainability, the approaches of supporting VSLAs through paid CBTs is shifted to trained village agents (one per VSLA). Village agents are members of VSLAs and they offer timely services to their respective groups.&#x2022; In general the average household income has increased from ETB 10,014 (baseline) to ETB 64,991. The increased HH income is mainly due to enhanced capacity of skill and knowledge of farmers in CSA, access to agricultural inputs and finances as well as access to agricultural markets. Project Four (The Market system Project implemented by Farm Africa, ORDA and Mercy Corps) &#x2022; A farmer with the age of 54 years engaged in CSA have produced 6qts (Sacks) of chick pea, sold to the cooperative and earned 18,000birr. The farmer explained that he counted such an amount (ETB 18,000) for the first&#xA0; time in his life.&#x2022; Provision of training for 40 participants in agri-input marketing and handling, establishment of one agro-dealer, strengthening of one multi-purpose cooperative to engage in agri-input marketing, strengthening of two seed multiplier coops, facilitation of market linkage among wholesalers and local agro-dealers and facilitation of stakeholder meetings among agri-inputs actors to strengthen regulatory aspect have been undertaken.&#x2022; Training has been facilitated to 48 government experts and 92 farmers in application of vermi composting, green house management and Tomato stacking, Eco-green liquid fertilization and bio-fertilization to improve&#xA0;agricultural production and producitivity.&#x2022; 12 producers and marketing groups (PMGs) organized and training provided to 288 farmers and 47 government staff on how to organize PMGs and run market-based production system. The establishment of PMGs is a new way of running market oriented agricultural production that facilitates easy access of small producers to new technology, information and business services in rural areas that contribute to boosting productivity; intensification and commercialization of smallholder agriculture, thereby increasing their incomes and ensuring food security. &#x2022; Capacity&#xA0; building training given to 64 participants on agricultural product marketing and business management.&#x2022; One vegetable shed construction started at Kemissie town in cost share basis to enhance vegetable and agri-product marketing.&#x2022; Business to Business meeting was facilitated among mung bean market actors so as to discuss potential challenges and device joint solutions in the mung bean market.&#x2022; The project has facilitated trainings and consultative workshops aimed at building capacity and awareness level of Amhara Credit and Saving Institution (ACSI) front line&#xA0;staff and its government partners and stakeholders on Sharia-compliant products and services. As a result, ETB 3,264,958 saving was mobilized from 619 (408 male, 211 female) clients, and birr 5,144,088 financing was delivered to fifty (50) small business operators in agriculture and service sectors. This making total number of savers 1064 (255 female), total amount of saving reached birr 10,047,890 and total value of disbursement so far is 5,747,618.00 for 54 clients in agricultural and service sectors.&#x2022; Consultative meetings have been conducted with watershed committee members, government, and project frontline staff to upgrade comprehensive land husbandry (CLH) practices. Experience sharing on CLH practices, establishment of four vermin worm multiplications sites and introduction of agroforestry practices have been done as part of NRM.&#x2022; Farm Africa in partnership with implementing partners have developed a Covid-19 risk adaptation plan for 2020. Overall, the project has facilitated support to the community and health institutions in 17 intervention woredas of the program to protect themselves from the pandemic. The specific Covid-19 response supports are described below.&#x2022; Creating public awareness of the community regarding the prevention ways of COVID-19 through distribution of brochures and posting of stickers on public gathering areas as well as using local FM radio and conducting community outreach programs. More than 300,000 community members are reached in community awareness education.&#x2022; Creating sustainable income sources for 3,887poor women headed HHs which are highly affected by pandemic through facilitating IGA. Sub-programme 2: Natural Resources Management for Resilience and Economic Development in Rural Ethiopia This sub-programme of the G4F programme comprises two projects and is implemented in two project locations. These are: The Central Rift Valley (CRV) and its eastern and western escarpments; and Majang forest ecosystem and its associated landscapes in the southwest of Ethiopia. The program demonstrates interventions in an integrated multi-sectorial landscape approach.Consortium partners of CRV and Majang forest landscape management projects in collaboration with government and community partners have made utmost efforts to achieve the expected results of the project. Annual household survey was conducted to gauge the status of achievements compared to baseline values. The project has made good progresses in this reporting period and the main results are summarized below.&#x2022; Average annual deforestation rate decreased by 2.27% against the baseline value of 4%. The&#xA0; reduction of deforestation is believed to have been achieved due to improved awareness raising of the community members and government staffs through various capacity buildings on proper forest resource management and development.&#x2022; The proportion of farmers who had access to water for small-scale irrigation practice in the last 12 months has increased from 62% to 72 % which is 125 % increment. This has been achieved through the supply and demonstration of 40 water pumps, 5 rope and washer pumps and 12 treadle pressure pumps to farmers to familiarize them with these improved agricultural technologies.&#x2022; Average annual gross income from IGAs increased from 0% baseline value to ETB 5,250 per HH per year. This change happened as a result of the engagement of beneficiaries in various IGA activities that include apiculture, fishing, vegetable and fruits production, soapproduction, VSLA, production of mud bricks, fuel efficient stoves, fattening of small sheep and goat, threshing and shelling technologies, vermicomposting and petty trading IGAs.&#x2022; Average knowledge, attitude and practice of members of water user association on landscape management has increased from 62% baseline value to 72%, which is 16% achievement.&#x2022; Average annual income of beekeeping farmers from honey production has increased from ETB 2,132 to ETB 3,500. This is 64% improvement in household income per year contributed to improve the livelihood of targeted households. This progress is as a result of the support of 434 beneficiaries with 497 improved beehives with full accessories (420 modern and 77 transitional Kenyan top bar). The project has also provided skills training on how to practically and successfully manage the beekeeping business. Improved beekeeping practice was found promising for women and youth groups. In this regard, 37 and 60 bee colonies were provided to women and youth beneficiaries respectively.&#x2022; The percentage of livestock farmers who were practicing improved livestock feeding system has increased from 29 % baseline value to 52% which is 79% of improvement.&#x2022; Average productivity of teff crop has risen from the baseline value 8.7quintals per hectare to 10 quintals per hectare which is 14.9% performance. Similarly, the average productivity of maize crop has rose from the baseline value 23.4 quintals to 38 quintals per hectare of land. This is 62 % achievement. The average productivity of wheat crop has increased from the baseline value of 26.2 quintals to 35 quintals per hectare of land. This is 33.6% achievement. The application of improved agricultural technologies, improved seeds, agric. inputs, skills trainings for project beneficiaries and agricultural extension workers as well as agricultural extension service had contributed to changes in the productivity of the main crops namely teff, maize and wheat crops.&#x2022; Average annual gross income of households has increased from ETB 25,254 baseline value to ETB 56,255 per HH per year. This is 122.8% achievement against the baseline value. The average annual gross income of male HHs reached ETB 57,010 per HH per year against ETB 25,281 baseline value which is 125.5 % achievement. Likewise, the average annual income of female HHs has increased from ETB 25,157 baseline value to ETB 53,358 per HH per year, 112 % improvement in the reporting period.&#x2022; Average number of CSA practices adopted by farmers has increased from 8 to 10 which is 25% progress against the baseline value. The main CSA practices promoted and applied by farmers include soil and water conservation, inter-cropping, crop rotation, agro-forestry, integrated soil fertility management, organic farming, improved seeds, application of improved agricultural technologies and improved agronomic practices.&#x2022; The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) in the targeted community has reached to 59.6% against the baseline value of 25% which is 138% of progress from the baseline value. Raising the awareness of the target community members in terms of teaching and sensitizing them to use contraceptive through peer educators, village health committees and health extension workers have contributed to improve the use of contraceptives.&#x2022; Average knowledge score of woreda government staffs on land management best practices particularly the degradation of soil and land, deforestation, loss of biodiversity and water as well as CSA practice reached 76% against 64% baseline value. This is 18.8% improvement from the base line value.&#x2022; The average organizational capacity of PMFCs in the areas of leadership, property management. forest management, business development and women empowerment has improved to 59%. In order to manage the forest resources in a sustainable way through the community participation and ownership the project has provided various capacity building trainings to the targeted PFMCs. &#x2022; Average annual gross income of targeted households from all sources has increased from ETB 28,633 baseline value to ETB 59, 850 per household per year. This is 109 % improvement made by the support of this project in this reporting period. Crop production and marketing has been the main (74%) source of income of the targeted households followed by non-timber forest products (19%) and other sources (7%).&#x2022; Total annual gross income from NTFPs sold by target farmers has increased from ETB 6,959 ETB baseline value to ETB 11,575 per HH per year. This is 66 % change of annual household income of the target beneficiaries.&#x2022; Average productivity of NTFP particularly honey harvested by farmers in the previous year has increased from 17.8 quintal&#xA0;(sacks) of baseline value to 40 quintal per farmer in kg/yr. This is 124.7 % progress performance made in this reporting period. The promotion of improved beekeeping management practices coupled with capacity building skill trainings as well as experience sharing have played vital role to the improved productivity of NTFPs&#xA0;.&#x2022; Average annual transaction amount of 15 PFMCs has increased from ETB 0% baseline value to ETB 36,845. This has enabled PFMCs to put in to practice proper management of their natural resources.&#x2022; The proportion of women represented in executive committee of PFMCs reached to 29% against the 0% baseline value. This significant change is due to various trainings related to gender and supporting of women on leadership skills, promoting VSLA as well as adult literacy and income generating activities. As a result, the gender equality and women empowerment are improving at the community level.&#x2022; Average OCA score of PFMCs in this reporting period has increased from 45% baseline value to 53% progress in the leadership, forest management, property management, business development and gender empowerment functions. OCA of all PFMCs ranged from 32% to 70% for different functions of OCA.&#x2022; Small business management, life skills and financial management and leadership skills were provided to women groups of VSLA and PFMCs. The activities and support have created opportunities for women to engage in small business management activities. To this end, average annual gross income of women engaged in various IGAs increased from 0 baseline value to ETB 2,247 per women per year which is significant achievement in the reporting period.&#x2022; The average KAP score of government staff in relation to PFM management reached to 73% against 45 % baseline value. This 62 % change has revealed that the concerned local government staffs have been engaged to ensure the sustainable management of the Majang biosphere reserve through increased participation, ownership and accountability.&#x2022; With the purpose to contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 pandemic the project has supported the supply of sanitation and hygienic materials and awareness activities at the community and local government levels.</narrative>
