   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh has been identified as one of the 22 most vulnerable countries affected by COVID-19 outbreak . The Government lockdown in Bangladesh have continued for a number of months has now been lifted with strict social distancing measures in place from 31st May. Despite this, Bangladesh is continuing to see growing numbers of positive cases and has witnessed the record of highest coronavirus deaths in a day (40 cases) on 31st May 2020. The official number of fatalities in Bangladesh now stands at 650 with under 50,000 positive cases. The average sample test result of 15.26% in Bangladesh is the 2nd highest in SAARC countries. 

To further compound this extremely challenging situation, on 20th May 2020, the destructive Super Cyclone Amphan passed through Bangladesh hit the coastal south west region of the country, particularly affecting the disadvantaged people in Khulna and Satkhira districts. Preliminary findings from the Needs Assessment Working Group indicate that over 2 million people have been affected with crops, homes and businesses destroyed. The food crisis has been worsened by the 2-month Lockdown preventing aid agencies to previously access these remote areas. and support to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable (who are not working) limited.  

With this project DAM aims to provide immediate support to at least 675 households of severely affected vulnerable people of DAM&#x2019;s ongoing project &#x201C;PEPSEP&#x201D;. The project is aligned with the government and private Hospitals. The proposed project will provide the &#x2018;food and dignity kit package&#x2019; for survival. The health awareness campaign will also be carried out in the urban area to reduce the impact of Covid-19 as much as possible.</narrative>
