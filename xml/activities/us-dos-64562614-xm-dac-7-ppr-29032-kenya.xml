   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our prior project with the Dutch Government, &#x201C;Subsistence to Self-Reliance &#x2013; Bringing the Power of Markets to Africa&#x2019;s Lowest-Income Farmers&#x201D; underscored our shared passion for inclusive economic development and showcased the key milestones that we can accomplish together. Core operating support from DGIS facilitated the strategic expansion of One Acre Fund&#x2019;s &#x2018;impact ecosystem.&#x2019; Within two years, we doubled the scale of our farmer network, launched operations in two new country programs (Malawi and Uganda), and rolled out impactful new products like tree planting kits and clean cookstoves at country-wide scale. Simultaneously, we refined our innovative systems-change platform, leveraging our core organizational competencies to improve large-scale public and private actors&#x2019; service to smallholders. This success has now placed One Acre Fund in a position where we can realistically envision moving the needle on hunger and poverty across the entire African continent. Our current project with DGIS, &#x201C;Leading the Charge to Eradicate Rural Poverty,&#x201D; aims to capture this powerful opportunity. The project involves a smartly structured two-part investment spanning September 15, 2018 &#x2013; December 31, 2022: First, DGIS is once again providing critical support to the varied, evolving platforms within our organization that lay the foundation for our growth and impact. Core operating support from DGIS will enhance and extend One Acre Fund&#x2019;s proven model by funding key strategic priorities across our M&amp;E, R&amp;D, and new country expansion units. Secondly, DGIS is also providing working capital to revolutionize One Acre Fund&#x2019;s growth trajectory. This injection to our &#x2018;permanent fund&#x2019; will completely fund our projected expansion of 245,000+ new farm families in 2019, bringing us past the 1 millionth farmer milestone. Crucially, farmers&#x2019; loan repayments will replenish our permanent fund each year, allowing us to re-extend this contribution to provide input loans to an estimated 245,000 farm families (including over 980,000 children) annually. This project will anchor One Acre Fund&#x2019;s expansion to directly serve 1.85 million farm families annually by year-end 2022. Simultaneously, it will help us reach an additional 3.5 million farmers via systems-change partnerships that are expressly designed to transform entire agricultural ecosystems. Together, the reach of these efforts will generate transformative change for rural communities across rural Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kenya Q4 2020 Country Update: In Q4, we kicked off operations supporting the 2021 long rains season (corresponding to 2021 reporting), with enrollment concluding in October and delivery and planting beginning in most areas. We enrolled 635,000 clients, and expect approximately 75-80% of these farmers will qualify and subsequently become One Acre Fund clients. COVID-19 continues to limit our operational capacity, but we are slowly reopening all field operations. While the team is working full-time in the field, they are working in small groups and through primarily 1-on-1 farmer follow-up rather than through large group meetings. We continue to regularly supply PPE (masks, soap, sanitizer) to keep the field team safe, and will revert to remote work if there is a concentration of COVID-19 in particular sites.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Though Kenya is one of our mature country programs, our systems-change work in the country remains at a much earlier stage than One Acre Fund&apos;s other country contexts (e.g., Rwanda). As mentioned in our previous reports, we are continuing to lay the groundwork for promising potential partnerships focused on rural retail and solar inputs. For example, to address farmers&apos; demand for high-quality products year-round, we launched our rural retail trial in late 2019. In August 2019, we incorporated poultry sales into this trial, selling 122 chickens to 22 farmers in the first week of this intervention. We will look to scale these up in subsequent years if M&amp;E demonstrates a strong impact and business case. Since the launch of this trial, we have sold 1,523 Rainbow Rooster chickens to over 100 farmers via 4 dukas.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">We served 68,000 clients in 2020 through our &quot;Duka&quot; agrodealer shops and partnerships. We achieved this by: 1) Ensuring distribution of an improved breed of chicken for sale at the Dukas (we sell 6-week-old Rainbow Rooster chickens, weighing an average of 450+ grams), 2) Improving SMS marketing for new and former Duka clients, 3) Exploring how best to utilize digital technology to boost the shops&#x2019; sales, 4) Providing accurate sales forecasting and inventory, and 5) Implementing a rolling delivery system to keep up with a growing volume of customers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Kenya program experienced a second year of challenging impact in 2019, primarily due to adverse weather. Poorly timed rains meant that maize yields were lower than expected. Still, One Acre Fund remained a good investment for the average farmer &#x2013; we estimate that Kenyan farmers achieved 43% higher incomes than their non-enrolled neighbors on activities we support. To preserve and deepen our impact moving forward, we are focused on improving farmer resilience through increased crop and income diversification (e.g., agroforestry, livestock, and other cash crops). We are running a number of distinct crop diversity trials in Central region, where farmers are already accustomed to growing a range of crops beyond maize and where we see strong potential for added impact. We are also working to optimize our input delivery schedule to better meet the needs of farmers in the northern part of Central region, where the rainy season is timed differently than our other program areas in Kenya.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Preliminary results indicate that we achieved per-farmer impact of $64 through our core program, below our internal targets. Primary drivers included COVID-related supply and training disruptions, flooding in some areas of Western Kenya, and crop pests. These external challenges reaffirm our commitment to bolstering farmer resilience through increased crop and income diversification, and meeting the needs of a broader range of clients through our Duka agrodealer shops.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, our Kenya program attained an social return on investment (SROI) of 3.8 falling below our 2019 core program target of 4.8. Our SROI was affected by various challenges which include: 1) Constrained rainfall (rain started, farmers planted, and then rain stopped for a full month when crops were most vulnerable), 2) The aforementioned impact shortfall - which was as a result of material expansion into newer program areas (where One Acre Fund has less experience), and 3) Below target loan repayment which resulted in a shortfall of our sustainability target allowing for only 79% of our field costs being covered by farmer loan repayments, compared to our deliberately ambitious target of 88%.</narrative>

      <comment>
       <narrative xml:lang="EN">SROI in 2020 is expected to be well below target (3-4:1) due to the unprecedented COVID-19 challenges this season. In particular, we recorded decreased revenues due to lower loan repayment; the Kenya program ended the 2020 season with 91.4% repayment, below our target and three-year average of 98%, yet largely in-line with COVID-19 updated projections. We attribute the below-target repayment rate to farmer cash constraints caused by the ongoing pandemic, coupled with flooding and locust infestation in some parts of the country.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Kenya program grew by 9% in 2020, reaching 444,000 farm families. Expansion was below historical growth due to impact challenges dating back to the last two seasons in which a perfect storm of ill-timed rainfall, crop damage from the invasive pest fall armyworm, and record-low maize prices reduced profits for farmers; these challenges understandably made farmers reluctant to commit to agricultural loans in 2020.</narrative>
