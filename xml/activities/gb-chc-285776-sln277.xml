   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Flood Risk Reduction in Western Rural</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Flooding has become almost an annual occurrence in Sierra Leone, resulting in destruction of property and loss of lives and livelihoods for thousands of vulnerable residents. Low lying coastal and hillside communities within the Western Area of the country, including Freetown (Western Urban) and surrounding regions of Western Rural, are often most impacted. While coordinated efforts at flood mitigation have been ongoing throughout Freetown, communities in Western Rural, including Tombo and its surrounding areas, have had little to no support to prepare for the imminent crisis. In fact, according to a rapid assessment supported by CAFOD and conducted by Street Child in July 2020, over 90% of the 615 homes assessed already experienced flooding on the 1st of July, over a month before the peak raining season. Many had collapsed walls, and 40 homes were completely destroyed and uninhabitable. Within the coming weeks, it is estimated that 2,000 households (11,200 people) will be affected by further flooding in Tombo. These challenges are anticipated in the ongoing context of a COVID-19 outbreak which has significantly impacted people&apos;s livelihoods, specifically access to disposable income which could have been used to help prevent and respond to some of the effects of flooding.</narrative>
