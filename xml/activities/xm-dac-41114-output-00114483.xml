       <narrative xml:lang="EN">4.1. The Inclusiveness Facility was launched during the Peer-Learning exchange programme in November 2018. Recommendations in the reports from the Participatory Inclusiveness Assessment (phase 1 of the project) and previous peer-learning programmes have been articulated in such a way that representatives of labour market institutions can easily identify the steps required to act upon them. Therefore, stakeholders are able to submit specific requests for TA and policy clinics to the IF.

4.2. Further to the first call, which was opened after the Peer Learning exchange programme &#x2018;Policy instruments to address the challenges of youth not in education, nor employment, or training (NEET) in CEE&#x2019;, the delegations from Serbia and North Macedonia submitted applications that were in line with the recommendations derived during the peer-learning event. Moldova, a first-time participant in the &#x2018;NEET peer-learning&#x2019; has applied to pilot the application of wage-subsides for vulnerable individuals and the new guidelines on workplace accommodation for people with disabilities. Following next round of Peer Learning exchange programme on profiling, Kosovo* submitted first IF request. Montenegrin labour market institutions expressed interest to follow up on recommendations from the phase 1 related to promotion of employment of persons with disabilities. 
During the phase 1 of the project, all PESs in the Western Balkans conducted a Participatory Inclusiveness Assessment based on the methodology that was developed together with the ILO. All PESs will review existing Action Plans to update and validate proposed measures and actions that are still relevant. Validation and assessment of the Action Plans will be done with the support of the ILO technical team and validated actions will be eligible for IF funding.
Details on use of IF (country, applying institution, title of action, purpose, total amount used)

The advisory report emerging from this activity has fed into the implementation of the National Employment Action Plan 2020 and contextually proposes policy interventions to be subsumed by the National Employment Strategy 2021-2030 when the design process starts (April 2019, 8.500 EUR)
