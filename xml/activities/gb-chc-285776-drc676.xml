  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will raise awareness on the danger of COVID-19, support communities with WASH activities and conduct protection activities. The project will be implemented in North Kivu and South Kivu provinces.  The cities in these provinces are particularly fragile and challenging urban context, marked by the long-term gaps in state services, corruption, high rates of unemployment, poverty and inequality, and daily insecurity. Most of these provinces have been the theater of instabilities and intertribal conflicts for many years and host many displaced. In the best of times, the majority of those living in these provinces exercise multiple and creative forms of d&#xE9;brouille (resourcefulness) to survive on a day to-day basis. Many are street-venders; they are classified into walking vendors, (porters, vegetable sellers and sellers of bread, cakes and pastries, etc.), and fixed vendors (battery and tyre repairers, mechanics and cobblers, etc.). the provinces also have a huge majority of those who relay on agriculture for their survival. 
Rumours around COVID&#x2013;19 abound as the national and provincial government has not communicated clearly about symptoms or prevention, information provided is confused and/or contradictory. In addition, with rumours that COVID-19 vaccine may be tested in DRC, many have become skeptical and believe the pandemic has been imported and the government is playing to gain international attention. Immediate help is needed to sensitize the communities and support vulnerable groups economically, particularly the most vulnerable who rely on informal sector, people living with disabilities, the elderly, the chronically ill, and child headed households. Alongside this immediate need for support, there is also a need to communicate best practices relating to prevention and mitigation and for a mass education campaigns to dispel myths and rumours spreading about COVID-19.</narrative>
