   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The effective pursuit of UNIDO&#x2019;s mandate has in recent years been subject to a number of challenges which have resulted in the Organization delivering a greater volume of services in spite of a dwindling pool of regular budgetary resources.

Systematizing and upgrading UNIDO&#x2019;s mechanisms for engagement with its Member States through the proposed project is thus necessary to better showcase its added value for countries in advancing ISID, stimulate greater engagement in UNIDO&#x2019;s work amongst its membership, and secure the necessary resources to effectively deliver its global mandate. The proposed approach responds to Member States&#x2019; requests made in the Abu Dhabi Declaration, and capitalizes on their continued support for the Organization&#x2019;s mandate to reach the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

A comprehensive, yet tailored engagement approach, which puts forward the entire array of UNIDO services as applied to global development challenges and national development priorities, provides the means to structure, coordinate and ensure consistency in interactions with Member States to achieve this objective. This is what the Member States Engagement Initiative (MSEI) proposes.

The immediate objective of the MSEI is to ensure Member States remain committed to UNIDO and systematically engage with the Organization on a number of priority themes, including climate change, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Decade of Action, and building back better from COVID-19. The Initiative aims to develop and harness the synergies between UNIDO&#x2019;s key areas of work, Member States&#x2019; development strategies and the global development landscape to strengthen relations with, and expand the membership of, the Organization, thereby increasing its political, technical and financial support to accelerate ISID around the world.

Building on the Organization&#x2019;s strengths &#x2013; including its normative role, convening power and technical assistance capacities &#x2013; the MSEI puts forward an integrated system of (re-)engagement revolving around three interconnected components:
&#x2022; The &#x201C;Development Dialogues&#x201D; (Output 1), which are a series of interactive dialogues with Member States, aiming to foster two-way exchanges on ongoing and planned activities to further tailor the Organization&#x2019;s services in line with countries&#x2019; stated interests and needs.
&#x2022; The &#x201C;Consultative Sessions&#x201D; (Output 2), which are a new forum for in-depth discussions on selected technical and policy issues to help propel the work of UNIDO and its Member States into intergovernmental processes or bodies of relevance to ISID.
&#x2022; A &#x201C;Member States relationship management&#x201D; approach (Output 3), which is a multifaceted stakeholder management methodology to strengthen engagement founded, among others, on the identification of key national stakeholders; the synergies between UNIDO&#x2019;s work and countries&#x2019; relevant priorities, policies and strategies; and the joint elaboration of cooperation roadmaps.

The project foresees the active and coordinated involvement and participation of all relevant UNIDO Directorates and Divisions to maximize efficiency, avoid possible overlaps and harness the potential of each interaction for strengthened Member States support and increased cooperation.

A successful execution of the project will ensure that Member States remain committed to the Organization and systematically engage with it in key focal areas, thereby contributing to securing the delivery of its mandate and helping the proliferation of ISID, in particular in the framework of the 2030 Agenda.</narrative>
