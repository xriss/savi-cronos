  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="NL">Lebanon continues to face challenges resulting from the massive influx of Syrian refugees as well as deep economic, financial and social crises which has been exacerbated by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts are reversing hard-won development gains, and 45% of Lebanese citizens now live in poverty. The overall objective of the proposed activity is to maintain or improve the food security and increase the resilience of the most vulnerable Lebanese population as well as Syrian refugees in Lebanon that are heavily affected by COVID-19. The program thus seeks to support both Lebanese as Syrian refugees in Lebanon: 13865 Syrian refugees and 1422 Lebanese families  (approx 8,532 Lebanese beneficiaries) in total. For vulnerable Lebanese citizens, the WFP aims to provide cash assistance to those affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on top of the current economic crisis in the country. This group is already scheduled to receive WFP food parcels to enable them to cope with the effects of the economic crisis and COVID-19.  Given the urban context and the strength of the markets, following the initial in-kind response, the primary modality of assistance will be through the provision of cash-based transfers.  This will boost the local economy and support its recovery while providing beneficiaries with choice to meet their food and basic needs. Furthermore, the proposal also sees to help Syrian refugees in Lebanon by means of cash-based transfer modalities, provided through an electronic card. These refugees are a severely vulnerable group, whose situation has been exacerbated by the COIVD-19 pandemic, since many of them lost their (informal) jobs in sectors such as farming, cleaning and manual work due to social distancing and isolation measures. Average income of these refugees has fallen (sometimes completely disappearing): A digital survey conducted by the Refugee Protection Watch (RPW) coalition between 30 March and 15 April, 2020, revealed 85 percent of Syrian and Syrian-Palestinian refugees (200 out of 234 respondents) had lost income as a consequence of COVID-19 response measures. Food vouchers, e-cards, is chosen as the primary modality of assistance for this group as the local market is capable of availing sufficient food for the host and refugee populations alike, eliminating the need to distribute large quantities of imported food.   In addition, food vouchers enable beneficiaries to choose their preferred food thereby allowing them to meet their individual consumption and nutritional needs more effectively as compared to in-kind assistance. This assistance boosts the local economy and provides beneficiaries with maximized choice to meet their food and nutrition needs. Through its retail strategy, WFP ensures that its beneficiaries in Lebanon have access to diverse, high-quality foods at competitive prices.</narrative>
