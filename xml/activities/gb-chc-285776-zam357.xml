   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cancel Zambia&apos;s Debt to Free up Resources to Fight COVID19</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak, a global pandemic on 11th March 2020. Zambia has now been affected by the pandemic with 1,200 confirmed cases as at 8th May 2020 and 10 deaths. According to the risk analysis conducted by the Ministry of Health, the coronavirus has the potential to affect 7,616,108 people in 43 districts of the ten provinces of Zambia. The pandemic has also the potential to impact the economy of the country and ultimately the resources to provide on-going provision of essential goods and services as well as the resources to respond to COVID-19. The ease of response to COVID-19 is aided by strong and stable economic fundamentals. 

With the COVID-19 pandemic government&#x2019;s revenues has dropped as most businesses in various value chains have been adversely affected. Further, the demands to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 has also meant that the little revenue that the government is currently generating is being channelled to COVID-19 mitigation efforts. But clearly with a constrained treasury due to debt and dropping revenues, it is justifiable that a permanent relief mechanism is assured for countries such as Zambia.    

Against this background, the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection (JCTR) in partnership with Caritas Zambia is seeking to bring about economic justice for the vulnerable and voiceless citizens of Zambia by influencing Zambia&#x2019;s lenders to cancel some of its debt. It is hoped that this will free up resources for public service delivery particularly in the education, health and water and sanitation sectors. It is also envisioned that the reduced debt burden will increase the country&#x2019;s ability to effectively and efficiently respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.</narrative>
