   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reprogrammed funds to mitigate the impact of COVID-19
United Nations Development Organization (UNDP) has applied to the Swedish Embassy in Ukraine for funding of 33 million SEK to carry out the &quot;Recovery and Peacebuilding  Programme&quot; in Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts during the period 2018-2021. 

The intervention aims at attaining new levels of good governance and citizens engagement for accessible and quality community security, law enforcement, access to justice and environmental protection services, most relevant to the region&#x2019;s conflict affected population, and increased social cohesion. The Project&#x2019;s interventions are organised under 4 key outputs, to be achieved through activities that will be carried out in no less than 20 territorial units (the Project&#x2019;s pilot territorial units), including 12 near the contact line. These outputs are: Output 1 &#x2013; Capable, inclusive and accountable local governance institutions contribute to conflict risks mitigation and peacebuilding; Output 2 - Enhanced community security, law enforcement and access to justice services that are closer to the people in conflict affected areas; Output 3 - Successfully decentralised and participatory environmental protection promotes a cleaner environment in the conflict affected areas and Output 4 - Social cohesion and citizens&#x2019; influence on local development decisions strengthened. 

The intervention&#x2019;s total budget is 129 million SEK (12, 8 million  USD), out of which Sweden will contribute 33 million SEK and Denmark will contribute approximately 96 million SEK (9.4 million USD). Switzerland will join later in the process, when the decision about its contribution is being taken.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project&#x2019;s overall goal is to promote peace and stabilisation in eastern Ukraine through capable, inclusive, responsive and accountable regional and local governments and service providers.
The key intended outcome of the Project is the attainment of new levels of good governance and citizens engagement for accessible and quality community security, law enforcement, access to justice and environmental protection services, most relevant to the region&#x2019;s conflict affected population, and increased social cohesion.
The Project&#x2019;s outcome is in line with United Nations Partnership Framework (UNPF)&#xA0;2018-2022 priorities and strategies focused on fulfilling the rights of the most marginalized and vulnerable populations in Ukraine, in particular with three of its strategic priorities (strategic pillars): Equitable access to quality and inclusive services &amp;amp; social protection (strategic pillar no 2), Democratic governance, rule of law and civic participation (strategic pillar no 3), Human security, social cohesion and recovery with a particular focus on eastern Ukraine (strategic pillar no 4). It is also in line with the national reforms and policies in the spheres of decentralisation, public administration reform, and reforms in the justice, law enforcement and security sectors. The Project approach builds on the core principle of &#x201C;leaving no one behind&#x201D;. It is particularly focused on SDG 11 (Sustainable Development of Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production), SDG 15 (Protect and Restore Terrestrial Ecosystems) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). SDGs detailed targets are provided in Section V - Results Framework. The Project&#x2019;s interventions are organised under 4 key outputs, to be achieved through activities that will be carried out in no less than 20 territorial units (Project&#x2019;s pilot territorial units), including 12 near the contact line: Output 1 &#x2013; Capable, inclusive and accountable local governance institutions contribute to conflict risks mitigation and peacebuilding; output 2 - Enhanced community security, law enforcement and access to justice services that are closer to the people in conflict affected areas; output 3 -&#xA0;Successfully decentralised and participatory environmental protection promotes a cleaner environment in the conflict affected areas and output 4 -&#xA0;Social cohesion and citizens&#x2019; influence on local development decisions strengthened.&#xA0;
Sweden has wished to softly earmark its funds for the Outputs 1 and 3.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the reporting year, the Programme progressed well towards achieving its goals across all of the areas (namely good governance and decentralization and environment protection - outputs 1 and 3 earmarked by Sweden), adapting to the new conditions and constrains imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerged in early 2020, the COVID-19 has largely influenced social and economic spheres and has further exacerbated existing vulnerabilities in local communities. As of 1 January, 1,069,517 cases of COVID-19 (18,731 deaths) were registered in Ukraine, including 102,838 cases in eastern Ukraine: in Donetsk (37,198), Luhansk (10,923) and Zaporizhzhia (54,717) oblasts. Despite several&#xA0;attempts to introduce ceasefire (including the Normandy meeting in Paris in 2019), hostilities in eastern Ukraine initially intensified, leading to an increase of civilian casualties until a renewal of the ceasefire came into effect at the end of July 2020. The local elections held on 25 October 2020 provided an opportunity for the local communities to elect new governments at different levels and thus formally establish these new territorial units. At the same time, due to the security situation, the government postponed local elections in 18 communities of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, 13 of them being the Programme&#x2019;s target communities, which hinders further local development and decentralisation in the conflict-affected areas. The analysis of the economic situation and trends during 2020 clearly indicates that the Programme&#x2019;s target oblasts face particularly dire predicaments, as a result of conflict and thus disruption of the economic activities, and most recently, COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, the evidence of the recently commissioned studies suggests that environmental hazards are a systemic and underlying problem in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In 2020 alone, Luhansk Oblast has suffered from 3 large wildfires that killed 11 people, injured dozens of local residents and ravaged several villages. The environmental situation in the region has been deteriorated by the armed conflict, a significant number of infrastructure facilities have been destroyed or damaged, posing a serious threat to people&#x2019;s health and safety. OUTPUT 1 &#x2013; Capable, inclusive and accountable local governance institutions contribute to conflict risks mitigation and peacebuilding: The Project&#xA0;has&#xA0;been working&#xA0;on the establishment of a citizens&#x2019; engagement system - the E-Democracy Universal Platform in 6 pilot communities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The platform will make the work of local authorities more transparent and will allow citizens to directly participate in the decision-making processes by taking part in the formulation of public budgeting, submitting initiatives to improve the well-being of their communities, as well as drawing attention of public servants to the particular development problems. During the reporting year, the standard equipment and furniture for the platform launch were purchased, and the premises for the location of the system were identified. 11 Citizens&#x2019; Advisory Bureaus (CAB) are active in conflict-affected communities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. During the reporting period, CABs rendered 1,534 quality administrative, legal and psychological services to the conflict-affected people (63% women), especially the most vulnerable groups, including IDPs and elderly. The services provided by CABs through various online platforms and via telephone are highly demanded by local citizens due to the COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. The Project continues to support the work of Public Councils (PC) in the target communities of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. As of today, 34 PCs&#xA0;are fully operational and serve as consultative and advisory bodies to foster citizens&#x2019; participation in the development, implementation and monitoring of public policies. To date, over 450 recommendations, developed by the PCs, have been implemented for recovery planning, infrastructure rehabilitation, improving waste management and environmental protection, reintegration of veterans, as well as community security and social cohesion. The Project facilitated the establishment of 6 Public Platforms for Influencing Decision-Making in the communities of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The Public Platforms are created as alternative advisory bodies to the local authorities, supporting effective interaction between local governance bodies and community members, to address pressing development issues in the communities.Furthermore, 29 Youth Public Councils17 are created engaging&#xA0;410 young women and men. The main objective of the youth councils is to engage young people in the processes of strategic planning and decision-making aimed at solving issues of socio-economic, political and cultural life of this target group. The Project facilitated participation of more than 850 (76% women) representatives of local authorities and civil society leaders from the target communities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in dedicated offline and online training sessions on participatory decision-making, public finance, e-democracy principles, effective interaction between local authorities and community members, public monitoring and anti-corruption control. As evidenced by the post-training surveys, the participants are now able to apply these new skills and knowledge in their daily work. In total, 12 NGOs were supported through the small grants programme to implement their initiatives aimed at promoting openness and accountability of local authorities, piloting of innovative e-government tools and establishing dialogue for effective cooperation between citizens and local authorities, benefiting over 10,000 people (75% - women). OUTPUT 3 &#x2013; Successfully decentralised and participatory environmental protection promotes a cleaner environment in the conflict affected areas: During 2019-2020, the Programme has elaborated an in-depth analysis of the environmental situation in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to identify environmental data gaps, analyse the status of regional ecosystems, the state of the environmental monitoring systems, public-private partnership framework. The analysis has already identified the lack of systemic data at regional, local and community levels on a number of pressing issues, including land conditions, pollution monitoring, environmental reporting, waste\water treatment. The Programme supported elaboration of environmental protection strategies for Bilovodsk and Krasnorichenske communities of Luhansk Oblast for the period 2020-2025. The strategies evolved into foundational documents that have set out concrete mechanisms and actions to ensure comprehensive approach to tackling environmental challenges, including but not limited to air pollution, energy efficiency, waste management, maintenance of ecosystem stability, sustainable use of natural resources. The strategies had also strengthened the public participation and information in decision-making processes, set the basis for education and communities&#x2019; awareness and expertise on environmental issues. A comprehensive study has been conducted to assess the environmental hazards existing in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Based on the data obtained, the priorities for reducing environmental hazards and improving the environment in eastern Ukraine have been identified to formulate recommendations for measures to mitigate existing challenges. In order to provide opportunities for community development, to assist in the streamlining of budgets and to enable the use of funds collected from the environmental tax, it was decided to assist Siversk and Soledar communities in Donetsk Oblast, as well as Popasna and Novoaidar communities in Luhansk Oblast, in writing their own environmental strategies for community development. The developed strategies will be a part of the strategic plan of community development, which will be considered at the meetings of local councils. From now on communities will be able to conduct strategic environmental assessment of territories and developing an environmental development programme. Additionally, a pilot to develop a local environmental strategy for Toretsk community has started in 2020. The strategic ecological assessment and the related action plan for the future amalgamated hromada is expected to be ready by mid 2021. RPP is preparing an upcoming study of the impact of the closure of non-profitable mines on the vital resources of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. It was based on the potential danger posed by the closure of non-profitable mines and the rapid increase in groundwater levels, which can cause environmental disaster (both for individual communities of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts). The interim results that will show the current state of flooding will be available in 2021.&#xA0; 67 participants - local government officials and activists gained skills in a 10-day online training on raising environmental awareness of representatives of local governments and public activists of target communities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The participants were trained in general provisions for the implementation of energy efficient solutions, rules for hazardous waste management (for example, medical), and also considered the current environmental legislation. 45 online trainings were held on Environmental safety of conflict-affected regions of Ukraine and strategic natural resources management in target communities of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. 57 representatives of local authorities, public organizations and local activists gained skills regarding the regulatory part of waste management, and the peculiarities of waste transportation logistics in communities. Based on the data on the annual number of forest fires in 2020 (and previous years), considering the size of the affected area that requires the implementation of a revitalization plan &#x2013; an expert is working on an analytical inspection of the area affected by the fires, conducts soil research etc. Based on world best practices, a modern programme and road map for revitalization of the affected area and restoration of the forest fund (based on the introduction of fast-growing tree species) will be developed by spring 2021. Environmental impact assessments of the construction of the regional landfill in Luhansk Oblast is an ongoing process of assessing the likely environmental consequences of the planned activity &#x2013; a process that provides an opportunity to make an informed decision about the planned activity. Unlike environmental monitoring, it is organized at a stage when pollution from the production facility does not yet occur and it is possible to minimize or even eliminate such pollution. The programme has initiated development&#xA0;and implementation of&#xA0;an interregional information and educational web portal to inform the population about the environmental situation in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as about unforeseen weather conditions (showers, blizzards, ice, etc.), as well as to raise public awareness ( to be launched&#xA0;in late 2021). 24 NGOs participated in 5-day online training on raising environmental awareness of public activists of target communities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The participants gained skills in the general rules of implementing energy efficient solutions and technologies of water supply operation, drainage and heating systems. The issues of introduction of renewable energy sources were considered and perspective directions of formation of raw material base were highlighted. Grant support has been provided to 39 local environmental initiatives (total cost is $157,425).</narrative>
