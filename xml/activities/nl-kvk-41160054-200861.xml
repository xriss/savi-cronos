   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash for people displaced by Kunduz fighting</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following a relatively quiet period, fighting between Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and a non-state armed group (NSAG) flared up across the north-east of Afghanistan mainly in Badakhshan, Kunduz and Takhar provinces, resulting in some 9,150 families (approximately 64,050 people) being displaced by ongoing fighting since 16 August in Kunduz province and further displacement is expected. Some 6,670 HH are seeking refuge in Kunduz city, 2,500 HH fled to remote villages in Khanabad District, 1,500 HH in Imam Sahib and 580 HH in Aqtash district (Flash update 2 UNOCHA, 27 August, 2020).  Many of the displaced families are staying with relatives or friends, or in rental accomodation while others are living in makeshift substandard shelters or in open spaces. The most urgent needs are shelter, food, Health care and safe drinking water. Due to lack of shelter, food and NFIs these vulnerable groups are experiencing the heat but soon the cold weather will arrive, and are also more prone to GBV and sexual violence. Furthermore, the lack of safe water and sanitation facilities are major public health and protection risks. The temporary shelters are overcrowded, making it impossible for people to follow the COVID-19 advise, further increasing risks on infections. Displacement is affecting women, girls, elderly, ill and disabled disproportionately, increasing their protection risks. Humanitarian partners are supporting local authorities to respond to people in need and have deployed inter-agency assessment teams to affected areas. During the regional cluster meeting on 26 August, both WFP and ECHO (through ERM) agreed to support 1,250 families with cash and food. However, with an estimated 50% (Kunduz Head of DoRR) of the affected people is vulnerable and in need of assistance, the assistance provided is not sufficient. As of yet the current response and attention for this crisis is insufficient. The regional UNOCHA office requested the Kabul UNOCHA office for uregent assistance of additional 2000 HH. There are very clear gaps identified in the response and needs are increasing rapidly especially as fighting continues. The aim of the assistance is therefore to address recently displaced people&apos;s most urgent, basic needs, saving lives, preventing the already precarious situation from worsening and families to apply negative coping strategies as many have already depleted their reserves.</narrative>
