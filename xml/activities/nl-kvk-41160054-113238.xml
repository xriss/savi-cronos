   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SP Afghanistan - Strategic Partnership</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The strategic partnership program focuses on 4 topics in Afghanistan: Inclusive and Engendered Peace, Security and Access to Justice, Health System Reform and Extractives. 
In Afghanistan, ongoing insecurity and conflict is restricting both women and youth, as well as civil society organizations (CSOs), from actively contributing to peacebuilding and participating in decision-making processes. Poverty and unemployment are increasingly affecting society&#x2019;s most vulnerable groups. Moreover, the National Unity Government has not yet sufficiently addressed the participation of these groups. 

The inclusive peace trajectory focuses on increasing the role and engagement of youth and women in peace processes. Supported by the Afghan Women&#x2019;s Network (AWN) women advocates in eight provinces discuss women&#x2019;s concerns and recommendations about women&#x2019;s role in the peace process with provincial-level peace councils and at a higher level. Meetings are held with the First Lady to take up the concerns. Furthermore, youth is trained in lobbying and advocacy, peace-building, and leadership and meet with the provincial peace committees to share youth concerns. Support is provided to the Youth Deputy Minister and his department. 

In the trajectory on access to Partner network SALAH focuses on improving the functioning of local courts and justice departments. Community members are trained to monitor court procedures and functioning. These monitoring reports and findings are discussed with justice sector authorities at the provincial and national levels to advocate for reform.  

In the health trajectory the Alliance of Health Organizations (AHO) is training the provincial health authorities and community health Shuras in eight provinces on alternative health financing . The capacities of community representatives is strengthened to engage with policymakers at provincial and national level. AHO works with the Ministry of Public Health with the objective of engaging local leaders and health Shura members in PPHCC meetings.
 
The extractives trajectory aims to ensure that communities benefit more from mining. This is essential since the government of Afghanistan and the international community have identified the mining sector as a source for supporting development. Partner organization the Human Rights Research and Advocacy Consortium focuses on improving the regulation of the mining industry and increasing community involvement, and advocates to ensure that the Ministry of Mining and Petroleum and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs take responsibility for their role in monitoring labor conditions in mining sites. Additionally, the program facilitates the establishment of a CSO network that monitors local situations and reports to the relevant authorities.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;The indicators measures the impact resulting from project interventions. Only count the number of people who gained access to services because of improved functioning of security of justice institutions in the project area during the reporting period. The improved service can result from a better (implementation of) legislative framework and/or strengthened capacities of the institutions. Since the number is likely to be based on calculation, a precise justification of how this was done needs to be provided (in comment section). This indicator can be linked to indicators for: 
1) improved legislation . However, improved legislation can NOT be assumed to benefit the entire population of the project area, and any claimed number of people m by calculating the people directly benefitting from their improved services of these institutions. Justice institutions can be part of the formal justice system or implement informal, customary law. Security institution include police, armed forces or peacekeeping missions.&quot;</narrative>
