   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing food crises in Afghanistan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan continues to decline in late 2020, characterized by high levels of ongoing violence and conflict caused by the stalled peace process, natural disasters including floods and winter, high rates of poverty with most of the population (30.5M of the 40M people) lacking and financial security, contributing to a worsening grave protection crisis, causing significant displacement and high multi-sector needs across the country. According the 2021 HRP 18.4M  Afghans need humanitarian assistance which is 46% of the population. People are characterized by low resilience and high vulnerabilities and often fall into a state of acute emergency and need urgent support to meet their immediate basic needs. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have a significant acute impact across Afghanistan and exacerbated already high levels of multi-sector needs for vulnerable communities due to loss of livelihoods and income, and reduced access to essential services as a result of government-imposed lockdowns, movement restrictions and market volatility, which has eroded coping mechanisms and increased negative coping strategies.

Within this context, food insecurity remains severe across Afghanistan, and which has worsened due to COVID-19 and conflict. Most notably, the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 is having a devastating impact on people&#x2019;s livelihoods and income, and coupled with chronic underlying poverty, has already started to further challenge families&#x2019; capacity to purchase essential food supplies. The lockdown and restrictions of mobility has had a negative impact on both the supply chain for basic commodities as well as on household livelihood and income opportunities, subjecting vulnerable households to reduced income, higher prices of food commodities, and reduced access to food due to supply chain disruptions. According to the latest IPC assessments, 7 of the 34 provinces are worse off and in IPC4.  Over the past 3 months the food security situation deteriorated, with an additional 388,000 people in IPC4, totalling the number of people in IPC4 nearly 1.5M (IPC Nov 2020). One of the worst affected provinces is Uruzgan province, which is specifically facing this worsening situation. The latest IPC analysis projects Uruzgan as escalating to IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) from November 2020 to March 2021, with 140,000 people in IPC 4 in addition to the approx. 140,000 in IPC3 (IPC Nov 2020), which is 50% of the population in the province.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cordaid/RRAA will specifically target vulnerable groups who are in either IPC 3 or 4. For identification of such beneficiaries Cordaid will use the cluster standard tool (food consumption score card) to obtain information regarding the food consumption score and coping strategies. Selected beneficiaries have low food consumption scores and high coping strategies. In addition, these vulnerable groups include women, children, the elderly, disabled and chronically ill, persons with special needs.</narrative>
