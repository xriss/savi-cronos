   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cash for Food for insecure people in Kot and Bati Kot districts of Nangarhar</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cordaid Conducted a raid need assessment during August 2020 in Kot, Bati Kot, Achin and Nazyan districts of Nangarhar. The assessment found that 76% of the respondents holds a National ID and that nearly 70% are under 18 yrs. 54.2% are females and 45.8% males. Half of the responding HH have been displaced or returning IDPs, making them more vulnerable to food insecurity and COVID-19. Because of high coping strategies practised by 82% of the respondents, combined with the vast majority of them (83%) having a poor food consumption score and no available food stocks (99%), people in the assessed areas are severely and acute food insecure. This is compounded by the lack of employment with more than 2/3 of the people being unemployed. Daily unskilled labour opportunities are limited (17%), which may be caused COVID-19 and related measures such as border closure. The effect of the COVID-19 measures is also reflected in people&#x2019;s income. People saw their income more than halved over the past period, reducing their purchasing power dramatically whilst prices increased. Access to water and sanitation is limited to half of the people, implying that hygiene practices are low. This represents a major public health risk and the situation is now exacerbated by COVID-19. With poor hygiene practices and insufficient access to water for sanitation, people will not be able to take COVID-19 precautionary measures. Although the majority of the people is living in houses, more than half of them live in partially destroyed shelters and nearly half of them are living in overcrowded one-room shelter unable to social-distance. The lack of adequate shelter, water and sanitation facilities and privacy is affecting women and girls in particular, representing a protection risk for women and girls. Furthermore, women and girls are also disproportionately affected by COVID-19, bearing the brunt of the pandemic now as well in addition to displacement and conflict. With winter arriving soon, the assessed people also raised the need for heating materials, warm clothes and blankets. People lack the means to protect themselves against winter and are likely to resort to the use of negative coping strategies which include reduction in number of meals (27%), incurring debts (13%) and 96% will send the children out to collect fire wood, potentially causing protection risks for them. Markets assessments were also conducted and showed that in all 4 target districts, markets were functional and sufficiently stocked with food and NFIs supplies. Marko and Jalalabad were the main markets supplying materials to the districts market. Although markets at district level are small, they have the capacity to restock within 24 hours. At the time of assessment, markets were not facing any shortages of commodities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to increase access to food of COVID-19 affected people who are in IPC phase 3 or phase 4 in Kot and Batikot of Nangarhar, through unconditional cash assistance, contributing to a minimum household food consumption score above 42.5. This will be achieved through cash for food assistance of half food basket for a period of 2 months, to complement beneficiaries&apos; existing food stocks.</narrative>
