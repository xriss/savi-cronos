  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On 28 September 2018, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, was struck by a tsunami triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. As of February 5th, 2019, the BNPB (the Indonesian Local Coordinating Body of Disaster Relief) estimated at least 4,340 people are confirmed to have died or missing, 4,438 with major injuries, and over 172,635 people internally displaced following the disaster. Besides the permanent displacement caused by the tsunami and liquefaction devastation, the earthquake caused widespread structural damage, displacing families temporarily from damaged and unsafe shelters. BNPB estimated 68,451 houses, 265 schools and 327 religious buldings were totally damaged. 

One year after the earthquake and tsunami at Centra Sulawesi, people are striving to have a better living and livelihood. Although the government and non government organizations have provided supports in different sectors, many still experienced displacement, unsafe and unsanitary living conditions, as well as psychological trauma and protection risks during and after the disaster. Families and communities need support replacing lost assets, especially safer temporary shelters to live, in the short-term and lost livelihoods and permanent shelters in the longer-term. They also still need supports to build greater resilience to future disasters through more decent place to live in, sustainable livelihoods, individual and group capacities in disaster risk reduction for a better and stronger personal and communal resilience.

Overall objective: Disaster-affected households in Central Sulawesi live in safe environment which are resilient to future disasters 
Specific Objective 1: 230 Disaster-affected households meet their basic needs for decent shelters and latrines 
Specific Objective 2: 5 Disaster-affected groups have more sustainable livelihoods 
Specific Objective 3: Caritas-PSE Diocese of Manado have a stronger capacity and more sustainable organization</narrative>
