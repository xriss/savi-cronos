   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the Ethiopia Humanitarian Response Plan 2020 Mid-Year Review (August 2020), there is drastic changes in the humanitarian context since the release of the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) on 28 January 2020 warranted an immediate revision of the HRP requirements, which was released on 9 June 2020. At the time, the humanitarian caseload considerably increased to 16.5 million people (up from 7 million) and the financial requirement to US$1.65 billion (up from $1 billion). The additional humanitarian needs mainly emanated from the multi-sector impact of the COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020, which disproportionately impacts crisis-affected communities
Flood hazard in Gambella regional state is a usual phenomenon that occurs during the rainy season mostly from July-September resulting into displacements and losses of properties, recurrently flood continues to be a challenge that deteriorates the humanitarian situation in the region. The region has experienced incidence of floods due to over-flow of major rivers such as Baro(Openo) and Gilo crossing different woredas and flash floods caused by heavy rainfall from inside the region or from the highlands of the Oromia Region, the flood cause displacement of people   and other humanitarian crisis that can hinders people from having basic necessity like food and social services. 

According to flood assessment report which was conducted from 3-15 August 2020, by the Gambella regional Health Bureau, indicates that the number of displaced persons increased and reaches to 19,821people/ 3,965HH in twelve Kebeles and the humanitarian response are not going well particularly there is limited lifesaving primary health care service in the area. Currently 25 health facilities impacted by IDPs and almost all stock-out of essential drugs reported. The poor PHC services have displayed for a couple of months and the IDPs and surrounding host communities now are suffering with shortages of drugs and other medical supplies.
The IRC directly targets IDPs and flood affected communities with poor access to PHC services. The IRC proposes implementation of emergency health response using surge support, for selected and highly affected three woredas (Wanthoa, Makuey and Dima) of Gambella People&#x2019;s National Regional state.

Covid-19 has been a globally identified infectious disease and, quickly developing into a pandemic affecting millions of people in the world. Ethiopia reported its first case of Covid-19 on the 13th of March, and since then widely spread to all regions of Ethiopia.The national health systems attention has shifted towards the Covid-19 preparedness and response using the scarce resources available. This is believed to further impair the health system, potentially depriving millions from getting lifesaving health services. IRC under this project will also work on prevention of the Covid-19 by community sensitization using different IEC methods and through distribution of IP items for health facilities.</narrative>
