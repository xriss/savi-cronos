  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The crisis in Syria is in its 9th year now, Due to the crisis, the economic situation of the people became very weak and their ability to pay for the costs of their basic needs especially the costs related to secondary health services which could be some times a life saving services.
The Syrian people now are also facing the effects of the global pandemic (COVID-19) on their economy, the costs of the health services became very high in comparison with the average income of the Syrian people and could reach 5 times their monthly income for the simplest medical surgery. While putting the spotlight on this severe needs in the community, we want to focus on the needs in the health sector in the eastern and northern rural of Homs.
Since Al-Birr Association is a main actor in the health sector specially in Homs city and its rural, we notice the huge gap between the financial ability for people and the costs of the health services. Al-Birr is already providing health services to people in need through its medical centers and hospitals with minimal prices and also covers the costs of the health services for people through referrals for people that are most in need. But due to the weak financial situation to people and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic situation, the numbers of people in need and requesting for referrals from the association are getting significantly larger and the financial abilities of the association can&apos;t cover the needs of people. 
Al-Birr has medical centers which are spread in Homs city and its eastern and northern rural area. In addition, Al-Birr is operating Al-Kindi Hospital and own Al-Birr Hospital in Homs and they are both serving a large number of people in need in Homs and its rural.
Al-Birr is looking forward to respond to the rising needs of the people related to secondary health services especially the life saving ones such as cardiac operations in cooperation with SHF.
The project aims at covering the gap we&apos;ve noticed through our health centers, hospitals and referral office of the Association, where it&apos;s clear that there is a lack of financial ability of people to cover their needs of health service through referral mechanism to people in need to do the medical operations they need in the hospitals they choose and the Association will cover the expenses of their operations through the fund provided by SHF for the project.
The project is mainly directed to the people in need in northern rural areas of Homs in (Talbissah, Rastan, Houla) since they&apos;re areas of high severity of needs. In addition, it will be directed to areas in eastern rural of Homs with high severity of needs (Qaryateen-Forqlos) and the returnees to Tadmor and the IDPs and returnees from Rukban who settled in different areas in Homs city and its northern and eastern of Homs.</narrative>
