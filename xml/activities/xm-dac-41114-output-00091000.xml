       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.1. Energy-efficient street lighting implemented in Ashgabat and technical justification prepared
1.2. Development of sustainable urban transport solutions in Ashgabat to be approved by the city (in order to avoid spending funds for activities that have little chance to be ever implemented) or dropped from the list of project activities in case of zero engagement of the city authorities
1.3. Approval received from the city authorities to apply city plans for sustainable development to be designed by the Project
1.4. Volumes of waste fractions that can be recycled in a commercially viable and sustainable way are identified. Plans to introduce separate collection of these fractions are prepared and proved by the city authorities in Ashgabat. Different required stakeholders commit resources to a joint effort with the project being a liaison between the interested parties. The volume of recycling starts to increase in Ashgabat by year-end.
2.1 Practice on reducing energy consumption, water use, and waste implemented by at least one hotel in Avaza.
2.2 Demonstration and replication of solar-powered public lighting is made subject to the Ministry of Energy providing information on off-the-grid sites where such installations make economic sense and are sustainable from life-cycle-costing (LCC) perspective.
2.3 The city authorities  in Avaza share information about traffic routes and commit to implement project&#x2019;s recommendations regarding optimizing efficient surface transportation in Avaza
2.4 Managerial and technical capacity of planners, officials, and facility managers in Awaza enhanced via training
3.1 National policy developed and adopted in support of integrated and scaled-up &quot;green&quot; urban development practices. 
3.2 The &#xAB;Turkmen motor transport&#xBB; agency of Ministry of Industry and Communications agrees to consider amending existing standards for fuel efficiency of imported cars in order to create incentives for a switch to higher fuel efficiency vehicles.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.1 Partially achieved (More than 27,000 LED lamps and 28,000 LED luminaires were installed across Ashgabat using public funds following commitment to cooperate with the Project from the city authorities on LED lighting upgrade).

1.2 - Partially achieved. 
1.3 - Partially achieved
1.4 - Partially achieved 
(The Project has suffered from a late actual project start: the activities began in July 2018 instead of December 2017 due to a change in the implementing partner. The downgrade of the original sponsor of the Project Document (Ministry of Environment) to the status of a committee within the Ministry of Agriculture has resulted in difficulties in project activities implementation. Also, there was a re-organization of other key national partner &#x2013; the Ministry of Transport become as the Agency. The project is planning to resume political dialogue on transport and waste management issues in 2020. The project team has also prepared a plan to compensate for lack of cooperation of the two aforementioned actors by increasing its dialogue with the Ministry of Energy (to focus more on stimulating a transition to smart grid-related infrastructure investments).

2.1 - Partially achieved
2.2 - Partially achieved
2.3 - Partially achieved
( The hotel complex initially selected for the audit rejected the Project&#x2019;s offer for a free audit. The Project is now focusing on liaising with another hotel complex owned by another stakeholder (Ministry of Energy) that is more committed to Project Document objectives (a transition to smart grid). 

2.4 - Accomplished. (On 6 November 2019 Project held seminar-training on &#x201C;Possibility of reduction of energy consumption at hotels of National Touristic Zone &#x201C;Avaza&#x201D;&#x201D; for related specialists of government organizations and hotel representatives). 

3.1 - Partially achieved
3.2 - Partially achieved
(The Project has faced stiff resistance from the initially well-subscribed stakeholders (mayoral office of Ashgabat and the Ministry of Transport) to pilot any initiatives proposed in the Project Document. The Project Team is now working successfully with the Ministry of Energy on piloting street lighting projects. The Project is therefore planning to invest available resources to develop national policies in assisting the Ministry of Energy in its ongoing renewable energy and smart grid development work.).</narrative>

(The Ministry of Transport &#x2013; which was as a project partner responsible for sharing information with the project on the public transport routes to be optimized (which was reorganized in January 2019 &#x2013; 5 months after the Inception Workshop -  into Agency &#x201C;TurkmenAvtoTransport&#x201D; subordinated to the newly created Ministry of Industry and Communication, and then again in February 2020 reorganized as a separate Agency) is not engaging with the project despite numerous open channels of engagement and communication. Furthermore, Cities project and the Ministry of Energy of Turkmenistan has begun joint work on the introduction of new energy efficiency technologies into the electric networks of Ashgabat city through the supply of energy-saving equipment. New transformers with a voltage of 10/0.4 kV in amount of 60 pcs by UNDP and 360 pcs by Ministry will be installed in the electric networks of power consumers of newly connected settlements of the city of Ashgabat. Construction and installation works are planned to be carried out by divisions of the Ministry of Energy, and at the expense of the saved funds, it is planned to purchase cable products for the reconstruction of distribution electric networks. As a result of these works, along with improving the reliability of power supply to consumers, technological costs of electric energy on distribution electric networks will also decrease. The result of such practical cooperation between UNDP and the Ministry of Energy will be the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of more than 500 000  tons of CO2. 
As a result of cooperation with the Ministry of Energy, a draft of a new Law of Turkmenistan &quot;On Energy Saving and Energy Efficiency&quot; and number of regulatory legal acts aimed at introducing the new energy efficiency technologies into production were jointly developed. Concurrently, joint work is underway on development of draft regulatory legal and regulatory technical documents on energy efficiency. In addition, new draft Law of Turkmenistan on &#x201C;Renewable Energy&#x201D; was developed. Project developed National Strategy of Turkmenistan on &#x201C;Development of Renewable Energy&#x201D; which was approved by the President of Turkmenistan on 4 December 2020. Moreover, Project jointly with the Nature Protection Society of Turkmenistan (NGO) launched second campaign on waste collection and sorting among residents of Ashgabat city. This time, campaign includes not only collection and sorting of plastic waste but also it covers paper and glass. It needs to be noted that the residents of the city have been actively taking part in this campaign in daily basis. Moreover, normative-regulatory document to the Law of Turkmenistan &#x201C;On Waste&#x201D; is being developed. At present, project is in the process of determining the pilot site for waste recycling and sorting with the Municipality of Ashgabat city. Due to the COVID-19, internal flights were restricted and thus, activities related to waste in Avaza are halted. Development of several normative technical documentation and regulatory legal acts to the Law of Turkmenistan &quot;On waste&quot; have been started by the initiative and support by UNDP Cities project. In addition, it supports the development of the draft of new National Strategy of Turkmenistan in the field of waste management as another step towards sustainability.)

(Avaza Touristic Zone is closed by the government of Turkmenistan due to the COVID-19. Therefore, project is unable to get access to Avaza and implement its activities. However, Regardless of restrictions in Avaza, project switched its some activities to Ashgabat. The project has identified pilot hotel for conducting energy audit in &#xAB;Grand Turkmen&#xBB; hotel in Ashgabat. Related works on energy audit are being conducted with the involvement of project international consultant on energy audit and national consultants.)

3.1 Partially achieved

There were several articles published in various official and private newspaper, websites of the country. One of the prominent project activities that was highlighted by the government was the meeting of the Interdepartmental Working Group on the working out the National Strategy of Turkmenistan on the Development of Renewable Energy with the participation of project international and local specialists in a video conference format. Moreover, there are numerous articles on waste management regarding the second campaign on waste collection and sorting from population of Turkmenistan. Lastly, it needs to be underlined that the project assisted in procurement of air and water contamination monitoring equipment for Ecological Control Service of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment Protection of Turkmenistan.</narrative>
