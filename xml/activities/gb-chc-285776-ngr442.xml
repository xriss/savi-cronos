   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time. (it could be said to be the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two). Since its emergence in China in December 2019, the virus has spread to 213 countries (including Nigeria) with the number of confirmed cases rising daily in Africa the Americas, and Europe. Countries are racing to slow the spread of the virus by testing and treating patients, carrying out contact tracing, limiting travel, quarantining citizens, and cancelling large gatherings such as sporting events, concerts, and schools.
The wide increasing spread of Coronavirus across the globe has dominated global attention. In Nigeria the situation is not different as the Government at all level is committed to the fight against the increasing spread of COVID-19. The presidential task force on containment of COVID-19 has from time to time brief Nigerians on the current trends of activities and efforts put in by the Government, organization and individuals to contain the spread of the Coronavirus. The spread of the virus has tremendously increased in the last two months (from Feb. to date 2020). The Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) has reported 12,801 confirmed cases as at 11:55pm, 8th of June 2020. Nigerian government is faced with hard choices about how to manage the virus. State Governors in Nigeria have already imposed border restrictions. Many are placing partial or blanket bans on public gatherings or insisting that citizen&#x2019;s shelter at home. These are necessary but also costly measures.
In Maiduguri Diocese, there is a wide spread notion by general public mostly in remote communities that Coronavirus is a lie and the perception that, it is a foreign and rich persons&#x2019; sickness. Preventive measures such as social distancing, regular washing of hands or the use of hand sanitizers and other guidelines stipulated by the relevant authorities such as the NCDC are not properly adhered to. This Project is all about creating awareness on Covid-19 prevention and spread by enabling the vulnerable persons to have access to genuine knowledge on COVID19 and sanitary facilities to help curb its spread.</narrative>
