With nearly 50 seasoned professionals comprising of Clinical and Behavioural Psychologists, Educational and Child Psychologists, Consultant Psychiatrists, Public Health Specialists and Counsellors. With our contribution to the psychosocial space is unparalleled.This project will build on the strengths and lessons learned from previous and ongoing programs led by Oxfam. Specifically, the action will complement the ongoing interventions of the EU Support to Food Security and Resilience in Northern Nigeria# (PROACT) in Adamawa and Kebbi states in northern Nigeria. The project is benefiting over 25,000 vulnerable farming households in 80 rural communities, 70% of whom will be women. These Vulnerable households, were in the very poor and poor categories prior to Oxfam intervention in target locations of this project, and were beginning to attain comfortable positions in terms offood security and livelihoods outcomes before the COVID 19 pandemic struck. These populations  are now at risk of having their strengthened resilience attenuated as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. The project will also use the findings of the recent rapid care analysis conducted in Adamawa and Kebbi address gender based violence issues arising from the Covid 19 pandemic.  The power relations which places women as the subordinate gender groups withinthis society, leaves the women vulnerable to GBV violence, as there is a power imbalance between men and women as highlighted by the RGA will also be addressed  by this Project.</narrative>
